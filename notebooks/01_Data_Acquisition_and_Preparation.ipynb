    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of **predicting the retraction risk of a scientific paper** at the moment of its publication. The core idea is to identify subtle, quantifiable patterns in a paper's metadata, authorship, and content that correlate with a higher likelihood of future retraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "By training on a comprehensive dataset of previously retracted articles and a carefully constructed control group of non-retracted papers, the model will learn to distinguish high-risk publications from sound research, providing a valuable tool for researchers, editors, and the public.\n",

         "Our study aims to discuss the association between inflammation-related factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with susceptibility and recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We used Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to characterize the genetic variation of five SNPs in 194 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and 231 healthy subjects. All statistical analysis is performed with statistical product and service solutions v13.0; odds ratio (OR) value and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated. There is no relationship between TGFŒ≤1 -869 T/C, IL-6 -634C/G, TGFŒ≤1 -509C/T, IL1 -511C/T and nasopharyngeal carcinoma susceptibility. Both single factor and multiple factors analysis showed that IL1a -889 T/T genotype is significantly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in decreasing the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A highly significant association was found between IL1a -889 T/T genotype and protective genotype as defined by various pathological types. This is more obvious in the protective genotype of the non-keratin-type squamous carcinoma undifferentiated type. We also discovered that genotype G/G and C/G + G/G of IL6 -634 gene are associated with reduced recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. IL1a -889 gene polymorphism and susceptibility is related to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and can potentially decrease the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the Han Chinese population in north China. IL1-889 TT genotype is protective genotype for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We have provided evidence that the GG genotype of the IL6 -634 gene is associated with recurrent risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The G allele is the protective gene of nasopharyngeal carcinoma recurrence.",

         "In order to have an in-depth understanding of the youth group in this special industry and find out the problems of express delivery in life, work, and emotion, as well as the difficulties e faces in social support, this paper presents a research method of rights and interests protection strategy of express employees based on big data environment. This method comprehensively analyzes the protection of the rights and interests of express employees in the context of big data. It is found that 19.4% of couriers say they will be bored because they feel that it is not within their scope of responsibility, so they will be very reluctant. The low self-identity of couriers may be one of the important reasons why some couriers have this idea. Therefore, on this basis, a mathematical model for the protection of the rights and interests of express employees is established based on the factor analysis method, and the rights and interests of express workers in the era of big data are analyzed from the perspectives of the survival status of express workers and social support. The analysis results show that the rights and interests protection laws and regulations of the express industry and the social security system will restrict the express employees from obtaining their due rights and interests. From the perspective of laws and regulations, we can optimize the legal rights and interests of express employees and social security system.",

         "Objective. Liver cancer seriously threatens the health of people. Meanwhile, it has been reported that bufalin could act as an inhibitor in liver cancer. In addition, alisol B 23-acetate is a natural product derived from Alisma plantago-aquatica Linn which has an antitumor effect. In this study, we aimed to explore whether alisol B 23-acetate could increase the antitumor effect of bufalin on liver cancer. Methods. In order to detect the effect of alisol B 23-acetate in combination with bufalin on liver cancer, human liver cancer SMMC-7721 and MHCC97 cells were used as subjects. Bufalin and alisol B 23-acetate were performed on cells. Cell viability was tested by MTT assay. In addition, flow cytometry was performed to assess the cell apoptosis. Autophagy-related protein levels were tested by western blotting. Results. The data revealed that bufalin significantly decreased the viability of liver cancer cells, and the inhibitory effect was further increased by alisol B 23-acetate. In addition, alisol B 23-acetate notably enhanced the apoptotic effect of bufalin on liver cancer cells through mediation of Mcl-1, Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3. Meanwhile, alisol B 23-acetate in combination with bufalin induced the autophagy in liver cancer cells through mediation of Beclin-1 and p62. Furthermore, alisol B 23-acetate in combination with bufalin significantly downregulated the level of GSK-3Œ≤ and increased the expression of Œ≤-catenin in liver cancer cells. Conclusion. In summary, these findings provide the first evidence that alisol B 23-acetate improves the anticancer activity of bufalin on liver cancer through activation of the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin axis, and these outcomes might shed new lights on exploring the new methods against liver cancer.",

         "Purpose Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the malignant behavior of cancer. HOTAIR, a well-studied lncRNA, contributes to breast cancer development, and overexpression of HOTAIR predicts a poor prognosis. However, the regulatory role of HOTAIR in the cancer stem-like cell (CSC) subpopulation remains largely unknown. Our goal was to determine the regulatory functions of HOTAIR in the processes of self-renewal capacity, tumor formation and proliferation of CSCs derived from breast cancer. Methods We first enriched and incubated the CSC population derived from breast cancer cell line MCF7 (CSC-MCF7) or MDA-MB-231 (MB231, CSC-MB231). Self-renewal capacity and tumor formation were assessed in vitro and in vivo to determine the stemness of CSCs. We assessed the impact on ectopically upregulated or downregulated expression of HOTAIR in CSCs by soft agar, self-renewal capacity and CCK-8 assays. The functional domain of HOTAIR was determined by truncation. RT-qPCR and semiquantitative Western blotting were performed to detect the expression levels of genes of interest. Chromatin IP (ChIP) was employed to detect the transcriptional regulatory activity of p53 on its target gene. Results After the identification of CSC properties, RT-qPCR analysis revealed that HOTAIR, but not other cancer-associated lncRNAs, is highly upregulated in both CSC-MCF7 and CSC-MB231 populations compared with MCF7 and MB231 populations. By modulating the level of HOTAIR expression, we showed that HOTAIR tightly regulates the proliferation, colony formation, migration and self-renewal capacity of CSCs. Moreover, full-length HOTAIR transcriptionally inhibits miR-34a specifically, leading to upregulation of Sox2, which is targeted by miR-34a. Ectopic introduction of miR-34a mimics reverses the effects of HOTAIR on the physiological processes of CSCs, indicating that HOTAIR affects these processes, including self-renewal capacity; these effects are dependent on the regulation of Sox2 via miR-34a. Interestingly, tight transcriptional regulation of p53 by HOTAIR was found; accordingly, p21 is indirectly regulated by HOTAIR, resulting in cell cycle entry. Conclusion These results suggest that HOTAIR is a key regulator of proliferation, colony formation, invasion and self-renewal capacity in breast CSCs, which occurs in part through regulation of Sox2 and p53.",

         "A scientometric analysis was conducted to investigate the trends and development of crayfish research in terms of literature published, author, affiliation, and countries' collaborative networks, as well as the co-citation dataset (e.g., author, article, and keywords). The study analyzed 12,039 bibliographic datasets from the Web of Science, using CiteSpace as a tool for the co-citation analysis. The study revealed extraordinary increases in publication trends, with a total of 21,329 authors involved in approximately 80% of countries around the world (163/195) having conducted crayfish research. Unsurprisingly, countries such as the USA and China, followed by European countries, were among the top countries that have published crayfish-related studies. The findings also indicated that \"invasive crayfish\" was the world's top keyword for crayfish research. Crayfish species are important for both environmental sustainability (invasiveness and species composition) and social wellbeing (aquaculture), which provides directions for research, philanthropic, academic, government, and non-government organizations regarding how to invest limited resources into policies, programs, and research towards the future management of this species. Our study concluded that strategic collaboration among authors, institutions, and countries would be vital to tackle the issue of invasive crayfish species around the world.",

         "Objective. To investigate the effect of cantharidin on DNA damage in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and its possible mechanism. Methods. Cell proliferation assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were used to analyze the effects of cantharidin on cell proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The expression levels of DNA damage markers H2AX and P21 were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The expression of KDM4A and H3K36me3 was observed by western blot. The expression of KDM4A was regulated by siRNA or plasmid transfection. The effect of KDM4A on DNA damage induced by cantharidin in liver cancer was observed after overexpression and addiction of KDM4A. Results. Cantharidin can significantly inhibit the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and induce apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Cantharidin enhances the chemotherapy sensitivity of liver cancer by targeting the upregulation of KDM4A and the regulation of DNA damage induced by H3K36me3. Overexpression of KDM4A enhances DNA damage induced by cantharidin in HCC. KDM4A silencing attenuated the damage of cantharidin to the DNA of HCC cells. Conclusion. Cantharidin can inhibit the growth and promote apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Meanwhile, cantharidin can induce DNA damage in HCC cells. Mechanism studies have shown that cantharidin induces DNA damage through the demethylation of KDM4A-dependent histone H3K36.",

         "Abstract Background Early initiation of breastfeeding is putting the newborn to breast within one hour after birth. This study was aimed to assess prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding and its associated factors among mothers who delivered by cesarean section in South Gondar Zone hospitals Northwest Ethiopia, 2020. Methods An institutional based cross-sectional study was employed in South Gondar Zone hospitals from June 12 to July 03, 2020. A total of 356 cesarean delivered mothers were included. Data were collected using interviewer administered questionnaire and entered in to Epi Data version 4.2 and then exported to SPSS version 23.0. Logistic regression statistical analyses were used to identify factors associated with the outcome variables. Results The prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding among mothers who delivered by cesarean section was 51.9%. Mothers who had intended pregnancy [AOR = 2.69, 95% CI (1.34‚Äì5.38)], had professional guidance [AOR = 2.68, 95% CI (1.18‚Äì6.10)], had breastfeeding experience [AOR = 2.25, 95% CI (1.35‚Äì3.75)], and had four and above antenatal care visits [AOR = 2.20, 95% CI (1.24‚Äì3.91)] were positively associated with early initiation of breastfeeding among mothers who delivered by cesarean section. Conclusion Type of pregnancy, professional guidance, had four or more antenatal care and breastfeeding experience were significantly associated with early initiation of breast feeding among mothers who delivered by cesarean section. Community based breastfeeding education and counseling to pregnant mothers and encouraging all mothers to follow recommended ANC visit is should be recommended.",

         "5G is the latest-generation network that powers the IoT in pace with energy transformation essentially demanded during the modern world, especially the wireless form. Laser charging means laser beam irradiance of the solar cell panel to generate the photovoltaic power, and its way belongs to the WPT (Wireless Power Transfer). During the process, uncertain and ungovernable factors affect the energy transfer of efficiency. We have chosen the In0.3Ga0.7As material as the semiconductor of the PV (photovoltaic) panel to enhance its photoelectric conversion efficiency. Nevertheless, during the PV processing, nonlinearity elements impact the prediction modelling, making it extremely difficult. This paper proposes a new forecasting model based on SVM (Support Vector Machine) which is drawn from SLT (Statistical Learning Theory). Since the forecast belongs to classification issue essentially, the main idea of SVM is extending the SLT dimensions. We used the kernel function for realization. The PV is done under the different conditions (constant temperature, gradient temperature, or various laser power). The gathered data is processed by MATLAB and the 3rd software: LIBSVM. Without the parameter optimization, the prediction accuracy of classification is 80% (32/40) against 100% (40/40). Considering that the experiment data have small quantity, further make the over 650 data size samples which are calculated by the formula to verify the model. Through the effect of a few random factors, the result still remains 80% or higher. The research work has resulted in a solution of a fast and precise prediction model in laser charging solar cell panel. It also revealed the implicit relationship between the factors of the PV.",

         "<i>All-trans</i>-retinoic acid (<i>at</i>RA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A. The liver is the main storage organ of vitamin A, but activation of the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) in mouse liver and in human liver cell lines has also been shown. Although <i>at</i>RA treatment improves mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle in rodents, its role in modulating mitochondrial function in the liver is controversial, and little data are available regarding the human liver. The aim of this study was to determine whether <i>at</i>RA regulates hepatic mitochondrial activity. <i>at</i>RA treatment increased the mRNA and protein expression of multiple components of mitochondrial <i>Œ≤</i>-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and respiratory chain. Additionally, <i>at</i>RA increased mitochondrial biogenesis in human hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells with and without lipid loading based on peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1<i>Œ±</i> and 1<i>Œ≤</i> and nuclear respiratory factor 1 mRNA and mitochondrial DNA quantification. <i>at</i>RA also increased <i>Œ≤</i>-oxidation and ATP production in HepG2 cells and in human hepatocytes. Knockdown studies of RAR<i>Œ±</i>, RAR<i>Œ≤</i>, and PPAR<i>Œ¥</i> revealed that the enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and <i>Œ≤</i>-oxidation by <i>at</i>RA requires peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta. In vivo in mice, <i>at</i>RA treatment increased mitochondrial biogenesis markers after an overnight fast. Inhibition of <i>at</i>RA metabolism by talarozole, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 26 specific inhibitor, increased the effects of <i>at</i>RA on mitochondrial biogenesis markers in HepG2 cells and in vivo in mice. These studies show that <i>at</i>RA regulates mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism and that increasing <i>at</i>RA concentrations in human liver via CYP26 inhibition may increase mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid <i>Œ≤</i>-oxidation and provide therapeutic benefit in diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.",

         "Cervical spondylosis (CS) is a common clinical orthopedic disease. Among cervical spondyloses, cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR) is the most common. Its clinical manifestations are localized neck pain and radial numbness of the shoulder, upper arm, forearm, and even fingers. As far as the status quo is concerned, with the change of lifestyle and working style, the popularity of computer and other entertainment devices, people‚Äôs neck flexion time has increased significantly compared with the past, the incidence rate of CSR has also increased year by year, and the group of onset has become younger and younger. According to the symptoms, CSR in Chinese medicine belongs to the category of ‚Äúarthralgia syndrome‚Äù and ‚Äúbone arthralgia.‚Äù Western medicine has many side effects in the treatment of CSR, while surgical treatment is painful and expensive. Most patients are not willing to accept it. Traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture can relieve the pain, numbness, and other discomforts of CSR, and the acupuncture treatment has less trauma and is a simple operation. At present, there are few acupoint prescriptions for acupuncture in the treatment of CSR. Therefore, the analysis of acupuncture point selection based on computer vision image has important practical significance for the scientific and progressive exploration of CSR acupuncture treatment. In this paper, the etiology, pathology, and clinical manifestations of radical treatment of CS are deeply studied by using literature data and mathematical statistics. The prescription research experiment of acupuncture in the treatment of CSR based on computer was established, and the treatment method was studied by observing VAS, NPQ, and other indexes. The total effective rate was 95.13% in the experimental group and 85.72% in the control group. It is hoped that the research direction of this paper can provide reference for the diversified development of acupuncture and moxibustion and for the treatment ideas and methods of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy.",

         "Abstract Clostridium difficile strains are considered as one of the newly borne foodborne pathogens regarding the consumption of seafood products. The present study was done to assess the antibiotic resistance pattern and toxigenic gene profile of the C. difficile strains isolated from shellfish samples. Eight‚Äêhundred and twenty oyster, mussel, cockle, and clam samples were collected and cultured. C lostridium difficile isolates were subjected to polymerase chain reaction disk diffusion. Twenty‚Äêsix out of 820 (3.17%) shellfish samples were positive for C. difficile . Mussel (5.00%) and oyster (4.00%) were the most commonly contaminated samples. C lostridium difficile strains exhibited the highest prevalence of resistance against ampicillin (92.30%), penicillin (84.61%), amoxicillin (76.92%), moxifloxacin (65.38%), and metronidazole (57.69%). Prevalence of resistance against more than eight types of antibiotics was 15.38%. TcdA (50%), tcdB (30.76%), and cdtA (30.76%) were the most commonly detected toxigenic genes. C lostridium difficile strains harbored the highest prevalence of tcdA + tcdB (23.07%), tcdA + cdtA (19.23%), tcdB + cdtA (15.38%), and tcdA + tcdB + cdtA (11.53%) gene clusters. Shellfish samples have been considered as a potential source of toxigenic multidrug resistant C. difficile . Simultaneous presence of multiple toxigenic genes in the multidrug resistant C. difficile strains poses an important public health issue regarding the consumption of raw and shellfish. Practical applications Due to the high‚Äêconsumption rate of molluscan shellfish, they should have a high microbial quality. Clostridium difficile is common foodborne bacteria with an emergence of antibiotic resistance and toxin production. The current research is the first report of the isolation and study the antibiotic resistance and toxigenic gene profile of the C. difficile strains isolated from oyster, mussel, cockle, and clam samples caught from the Persian Gulf, Iran. Results represented that molluscan shellfish samples may act as a reservoir of Clostridium difficile with ability to transfer antibiotic resistance and toxin genes to human population.",

         "In order to deal with the problems of low detection accuracy and efficiency existing in traditional detection methods of body behavior characteristics in sports training, this paper proposes a new detection method of body behavior characteristics in sports training based on the grey correlation model. According to this method, the foreground binary image is obtained by the interframe difference method, and the action information and contour information are extracted, firstly. And then, the behavior feature descriptor is obtained. After the description of body behavior characteristics in sports training is completed, the grey correlation coefficient is calculated, and the complete observation equation of time delay estimation of image grey value under complex sports training background is established to complete the detection of body behavior characteristics. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional methods, the detection accuracy and efficiency of the text method can always maintain a high level, indicating that the practical application performance of this method is strong. In fact, the grey analysis does not attempt to find the best solution but does provide techniques for determining a good solution.",

         "Objective. The aim is to evaluate the effects of routine health care combined with oral vitamin D on linear growth in 5-year-old children. Materials and Methods. The 5-year-old children who received routine health care in Shiyan Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital from January 2019 to January 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into the supplement group and the non-supplement group according to whether or not they received oral vitamin D, and reasons for not taking oral vitamin D and its influence on children‚Äôs linear growth were analyzed. Results. A total of 368 children were enrolled, including 228 children in the supplement group, accounting for 61.96%. The analysis of the influencing factors of vitamin D supplementation showed that the proportion of children with well-educated parents and living in cities and towns was higher (all <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). Comparing the general situation of children in the two groups, it was found that the height, weight, and head circumference of children in the supplement group were notably higher than those in the non-supplement group (all <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). At age 4 and 5, the height of the supplement group was significantly higher than that of the non-supplement group (all <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.001</mn> </math> ). Linear analysis showed that the relationship between height and age in the supplement group was Y (height, cm) = 10.07 √ó X (age, years) + 61.18, while that in the non-supplement group was Y (height, cm) = 8.296 √ó X (age, years) + 62.81, with significant difference (all <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in the supplement group was significantly higher than that in the non-supplement group, and the proportion of children ‚â•75 nmol/L was evidently higher than that in the supplement group (all <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M5\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). In addition, the incidence of vitamin D-related hypercalcemia in the supplement group was significantly higher than that in the non-supplement group (all <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M6\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). Conclusion. There are still more children without vitamin D supplement, which is closely related to their parents‚Äô education background and place of residence. Additionally, vitamin D supplementation can promote growth and improve 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in children, but with the risk of related complications.",

         "Stock market plays a leading and crucial role in the market mechanism, which connects the savers and investors. So far, there is no uniform regulation on the disclosure requirement of environmental protection information in China. But companies are increasingly concerned about environmental protection and are committed to disclosing more information about environmental protection. It is important to analyze the information on stock market opening and environmental protection by computing technology. For the stock market, as voluntary disclosure of non-financial information, environmental protection information is an important supplement to financial information and is essential for the investors to make decisions. And it is the important content of capital market information. This article through the capital market opening opportunity: Shanghai (Shenzhen) Hong Kong stock connect (the stock market opening mentioned later in this paper all refers to the Shanghai (Shenzhen) Hong Kong stock connect), empirically investigates the stock market opening that affects the environmental protection information disclosure of the company. Our conclusion supports the views that the stock market opening improved the environmental protection information disclosure of the company and promotes the environmental protection behavior of enterprises. Through further analysis, this paper finds that after the officially carried out the stock market opening policy, the attention of many analysts and the participation of foreign institutional investors urge the management to take the initiative to reduce agency costs, which is an important influence mechanism for the stock market opening to affect the disclosure of enterprises‚Äô environmental protection information. The evidence of this study indicates that the stock market opening has an important impact on enterprises in China from the following aspects: improving the information disclosure of environmental protection, thus enhancing the company‚Äôs awareness of environment protecting, and improving the information quality of stock market in China.",

         "The advent of 5G technology has brought ease to many sectors of society and lifestyle. 5G technology has also made significant contributions to education, with a significant positive influence on physical education, especially for online learning. This study examined the online basketball learning system based on the 5G mobile communication technology as well as traditional face-to-face teaching and online learning and analyzed the students‚Äô performance using different evaluation techniques. The network latency is minimized by detecting and correcting the main energy-consuming activities of the 5G network to deliver effective online training to students utilizing 5G basketball teaching (5G_BBT). The features of 5G network nodes and channel characteristics are used to build a comprehensive model of basketball training. The information that could be sent to the user protocol is obtained from the teaching database, and the cluster formation is processed using crossover swarm optimization based on passive clustering. The maximum-likelihood na√Øve Bayes function is employed to compute the transmission of basketball data transmission, and the border gateway algorithm is used to calculate the optimum cluster path for transmitting the training material, based on distance and residual energy constraints. The model is evaluated in terms of latency energy efficiency and speed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed 5G networking scheme. The proposed algorithm achieved a high network speed of 98%, data transfer efficiency of 90%, and time complexity of 32%, respectively. The 5G-driven basketball training approach will provide students with objective, fair, and diversified learning and adaptive learning services to promote the overall development of students.",

         "INSAR images are inevitably contaminated by noise during the process of generation, transmission, compression, and reception. Noise not only affects the quality of the INSAR image, but also affects subsequent operations such as the design of corresponding filters, INSAR image segmentation, compression, restoration, and feature recognition. The INSAR image noise model is mainly divided into additive noise and multiplicative noise. Compared with additive noise, multiplicative noise is more complicated due to INSAR image correlation and non-Gaussian. Based on least squares algorithm system of additive and multiplicative mixed noise model, this paper proposes a method of using PCA to remove multiplicative gamma distribution noise. The pure noise coefficient is obtained by subtracting the original coefficient from the diagonal wavelet coefficient of the noisy image, and the mode of the local variance is calculated as the estimation value of the noise standard deviation. Experiments show that the proposed method can obtain more accurate estimation of noise; in particular in the case of less noise and more detailed image information, its effect is more obvious.",

         "Abstract Growing evidence suggested that the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate several pathophysiological processes in tumorigenesis and may be new biomarkers for tumor therapy. In this study, we studied the expression and role of lncRNA MT1JP in the development of bladder cancer. We demonstrated that the expression of MT1JP was downregulated in bladder tumor samples and cell lines. Ectopic expression of MT1JP suppressed cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion in bladder cancer. In addition, our result suggested that miR‚Äê214‚Äê3p overexpression decreased the luciferase activity of wild‚Äêtype MT1JP but not mutated‚Äêtype MT1JP and elevated expression of MT1JP decreased miR‚Äê214‚Äê3p expression in the bladder cancer cell. Furthermore, we indicated that the expression of miR‚Äê214‚Äê3p was upregulated in bladder tumor samples and cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR‚Äê214‚Äê3p promoted cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion in bladder cancer. MT1JP suppressed cell proliferation, cycle, and invasion via negative modulation of miR‚Äê214‚Äê3p in bladder cancer. These data suggested that lncRNA MT1JP acts a tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer progression, considering MT1JP as a new therapeutic target in bladder cancer.",

         "Hsa-microRNA (has-miR)-133a inactivates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway and suppresses the cell proliferation of myocardial fibroblasts by downregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. Bioinformatics analysis exhibits extended noncoding RNA HLA complex group 18 (lncRNA-HCG18) binds to hsa-miR-133a. The purpose of the current experiment is to explore whether lncRNA-HCG18 adsorbed hsa-miR-133a through sponging, resulting in decreased inhibition of hsa-miR-133a on EGFR and ultimately promoting the proliferation of myocardial fibroblasts. To verify and study the correlation and mechanism between lncRNA-HCG18, hsa-miR-133a, and their target genes. Firstly, after overexpression/silencing of lncRNA-HCG18 in myocardial fibroblasts, the level of hsa-miR-133a expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and the EGFR, ERK1/2, and p-ERK1/2 expression levels were assessed by Western blotting to confirm that upregulation of EGFR and p-ERK1/2 protein levels by overexpression of lncRNA-HCG18, siRNA lncRNA-HCG18 (siHCG18) reduced the EGFR and p-ERK1/2 protein levels. Then, the luciferase reporter gene system was used to verify that lncRNA-HCG18 regulated EGFR expression by inhibiting the function of the hsa-miR-133a regulatory target gene. Then, a RAP assay was used to confirm that lncRNA-HCG18 interacted with hsa-miR-133a. Finally, the analysis of CCK-8 results indicated that the cell proliferation of myocardial fibroblasts was significantly reduced by siHCG18 while reversed by overexpression of lncRNA-HCG18. Thus, lncRNA-HCG18 inhibited cell viability of cardiac fibroblasts via the hsa-miR-133a/EGFR axis, which was regarded as a regulator of cell proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts in cardiovascular diseases.",

         "The molecular mechanism of sulforaphane on the induction of metallothionein ( MT ) genes in HepG2 cells and the antiproliferative effects of sulforaphane were investigated in this study. Treatment of the cells with sulforaphane at non-toxicity concentration (0‚Äì20 ¬µM) resulted in coordinate increases in the induction of MT-I and MT-II mRNA, followed by corresponding increases in MT protein expression. Western blot analysis revealed the increased level of the transcription factor, Nrf2 in a time-dependent manner from sulforaphane-treated cells. Furthermore, sulforaphane activated the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 and PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK, abolished sulforaphane-induced MT protein expression, whereas SP600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK, had no significant effect. At relatively high concentration (30‚Äì100 ¬µM), sulforaphane is a cell growth modulator, as it induced apoptotic cell death characterized by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caused a rapid induction of caspase 3 activity, according to the appearance of the caspase 3 fragments and stimulated proteolytic cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, sulforaphane-induced apoptotic cell death was accompanied by upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X l protein. Sulforaphane-induced DNA fragmentation was blocked by the N -acetyl- l -cysteine and catalase, suggesting that the death signaling was triggered by oxidative stress. Taken together these results strongly suggest that at low concentrations of sulforaphane, activation of MAPKs, such as ERK and p38 pathway, lead to Nrf2-mediated MT gene expression. Whereas at a higher concentration, sulforaphane is an effective apoptosis inducer in HepG 2 cells through regulation of Bcl-2 family molecular and activation of ICE/Ced-3 protease (caspase 3) cascade. The results from this study may provide more evidence for its chemopreventive function.",

         "Pristine graphene, as the name suggests is the closest to graphite structurally among all the forms of graphene that are synthesized using different methods. High electronic conductivity, large surface area, and absence of defects make this perfect two-dimensional arrangement of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms a perfect support material for metal or metal oxide nanoparticles. We have introduced a quick and green route to synthesize CuO nanocomposites having pristine graphene as a support material by microwave assisted hydrothermal reaction. The nanocomposite exhibited very high catalytic activity in copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions compared with reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-CuO nanocomposite and CuO nanoparticles. The presence of pristine graphene in the nanocomposite increases the catalytic activity due to its better conductivity and ability to adsorb reactants through œÄ‚ÄìœÄ interaction than RGO. The pristine graphene-CuO nanocomposite showed very good recyclability with much less leaching of the metal from it. The CuAAC reactions could be completed in a short duration (1 h), at low reaction temperature (30 ¬∞C), using water as a \"green\" solvent with a small amount of the pristine graphene-CuO nanocomposite as catalyst (0.51 mol %) and sodium ascorbate as cocatalyst (1 mol %).",

         "Aberrant methylation of 5'gene promoter regions associated with gene silencing is an epigenetic phenomenon responsible for silencing of tumor suppressor genes in many cancer types. The aims of our study were to study the role of methylation of a large panel of genes during multistage pathogenesis and to correlate our findings with patient age and other clinico-pathological features. We investigated the aberrant promoter methylation profile of 19 genes in 92 colorectal cancers (CRCs) and corresponding nonmalignant epithelia (NME) (n = 57), and selected 15 genes for studying 26 colorectal adenomas (CAs). On the Basis of our results, the genes could be divided into 3 groups. Group 1 consisted of 13 genes whose methylation was tumor-specific. For 8 of these genes, the methylation frequencies in CAs were similar to those of CRCs, but significantly different from the frequencies in NME. Group 2, consisting of 2 genes demonstrating little or no methylation, were present in any sample type. In Group 3, consisting of 4 genes, relatively frequent methylation was present in both CRCs and NME, and the differences between these specimen types were not significant. Methylation of Group 1 genes were tightly correlated with each other, and these genes demonstrated increased methylation frequencies in CRCs with increasing age. Methylation was not correlated with other clinico-pathological features. In general, methylation frequencies of CAs were intermediate between CRCs and NME. Our study constitutes the most comprehensive methylation profile of CRCs, demonstrates that methylation commences early during CRC pathogenesis and is an age-related phenomenon.",

         "To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Xin Huang Pian skin patches for patients with acute gouty arthritis.In China, patients with acute gouty arthritis benefit from skin patcheses with herbal medicines. But the clinical effects of skin patches with Xin Huang Pian are rarely reported.A Randomized, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled Trial.The trial was performed from January 2015-December 2018 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in China. It was conducted with one intervention group (skin patches of Xin Huang Pian, N = 30) and one active control group (skin patches of Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel, N = 31). Participants and study investigators were both blinded to the treatment assignments. The primary outcomes were the improvement of joints' symptoms. The secondary outcomes were changes in white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.Skin patches of Xin Huang Pian showed quick effect on decreasing joint pain at 3rd day of treatment. Wherever only at 7th day, Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel markedly lowered joint pain. Xin Huang Pian also showed superior effect than Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel on improving joint swelling and range of motion and decreasing the levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. No adverse reactions were observed in skin patches of Xin Huang Pian treatment.Skin patches of Xin Huang Pian appeared to be safe and efficacious for relieving joint symptoms in patients with acute gouty arthritis. The mechanism might be associated with the decreased levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.Skin-patcheses with Xin Huang Pian are more effective than Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel on improving joint pain, swelling and range of motion. Xin Huang Pian treatment showed superior effects compared with Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel on decreasing levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with acute gouty arthritis may benefit from skin patches of Xin Huang Pian for effective relief from joint pain and swelling.

         "To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Xin Huang Pian skin patches for patients with acute gouty arthritis.In China, patients with acute gouty arthritis benefit from skin patcheses with herbal medicines. But the clinical effects of skin patches with Xin Huang Pian are rarely reported.A Randomized, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled Trial.The trial was performed from January 2015-December 2018 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in China. It was conducted with one intervention group (skin patches of Xin Huang Pian, N = 30) and one active control group (skin patches of Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel, N = 31). Participants and study investigators were both blinded to the treatment assignments. The primary outcomes were the improvement of joints' symptoms. The secondary outcomes were changes in white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.Skin patches of Xin Huang Pian showed quick effect on decreasing joint pain at 3rd day of treatment. Wherever only at 7th day, Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel markedly lowered joint pain. Xin Huang Pian also showed superior effect than Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel on improving joint swelling and range of motion and decreasing the levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. No adverse reactions were observed in skin patches of Xin Huang Pian treatment.Skin patches of Xin Huang Pian appeared to be safe and efficacious for relieving joint symptoms in patients with acute gouty arthritis. The mechanism might be associated with the decreased levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.Skin-patcheses with Xin Huang Pian are more effective than Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel on improving joint pain, swelling and range of motion. Xin Huang Pian treatment showed superior effects compared with Diclofenac Diethylamine Emulgel on decreasing levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with acute gouty arthritis may benefit from skin patches of Xin Huang Pian for effective relief from joint pain and swelling.

         "Abstract Introduction C‚Äêreactive protein (CRP) and cytokines levels could alter in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID‚Äê19) due to the inflammatory response caused by the virus. This analysis aimed to assess the relationship between the CRP levels and the levels of various cytokines in COVID‚Äê19 patients. Materials and Methods We searched the databases of PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science for relevant articles on May 29th, 2021. Applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the retrieved records underwent two‚Äêphase screenings; first, a title/abstract screening process, and then, a full‚Äêtext screening to find the eligible studies. Data for study variables were extracted, including the CRP levels and the levels of all reported cytokines. A strong and significant relationship between Interleukins and CRP was defined as: p ‚â§ 0.05, 0.7 ‚â§ r ‚â§ 1. Results In this study, 103 studies were included for systematic review and correlation analysis. The aggregate mean and SD of study variables were calculated and reported. The correlation between Interleukins and CRP was measured using correlation coefficient ( r ). It appeared that interleukin (IL)‚Äê10 has a moderate and significant relationship with CRP ( p ‚â§ 0.05, r = 0.472). IL‚Äê10 predicted almost 10% of CRP changes. Conclusion This correlation analysis suggests IL‚Äê10 is moderately correlated with CRP levels in patients with COVID‚Äê19 infection. A better understanding of the pro‚Äêinflammatory markers could contribute to the implementation of therapeutic and preventive approaches. More prospective studies are suggested to explore the relationship between CRP and cytokines as potential markers for the early identification of COVID‚Äê19 progression and severity.",

The threading dislocation density of the p-GaN was 4 √ó 10 6 cm ‚àí2 measured by cathodoluminescence mapping. Hall-effect measurements of p-GaN were carried out at a temperature in the range from 160 to 450 K. A low compensation ratio of less than 1% was revealed. We also obtained the depth of the Mg acceptor level of 235 meV considering the lowering effect by the Coulomb potential of ionized acceptors.

         "The study presents observations on anticancer therapeutic efficacy of magnetic fluid hyperthermia and a combination of hyperthermia and chemotherapy (i.e., integrative treatment) using an in vitro perfused and non-perfused 3D breast tumor model. The 3D in vitro breast tumor models were simulated using Comsol multiphysics, fabricated using specially designed chips, and treated with doxorubicin-loaded chitosan-coated La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (DC-LSMO) nanoparticles for hyperthermia and combination therapy in both perfused and non-perfused conditions. Computation confirmed uniform heat distribution throughout the scaffold for both the models. The findings indicate that both hyperthermia and combination treatment could trigger apoptotic cell death in the perfused and non-perfused models in varying degrees. Specifically, the perfused tumors were more resistant to therapy than the non-perfused ones. The efficacy of anticancer treatment decreased with increasing physiological complexity of the tumor model. The combination (hyperthermia and chemotherapy) treatment showed enhanced efficacy over hyperthermia alone. This is a pilot study to investigate the effects of magnetic fluid hyperthermia-chemotherapy treatment using perfused and non-perfused 3D in vitro models of tumor. The feasibility of using 3D cell culture models for contributing to our understanding of cancer and its treatment was also determined as a part of this work.",

         "With the economic development in recent years and the holding of the 2022 Winter Olympics, ice and snow sports have been widely popularized and promoted around the world. More and more outdoor sportsmen are appearing, and the movement is an extremely intense outdoor sport, so it is very popular among outdoor enthusiasts, but physical injuries can easily occur during exercise. Therefore, aiming at this problem, this paper studies the extraction system of the movement technical indicators. This paper is aimed at studying the extraction system of the movement technical indicators based on the Internet of Things. This paper proposes the development of the Internet of Things and the importance of the movement sports, describes the concepts of the two in detail, and proposes a wireless sensor network method using Internet of Things. The experimental results show that the average opening percentage of Chinese ski resorts in 2016 was around 8.5%. By 2021, the opening percentage of Chinese ski resorts will reach a maximum of around 37%. It can be seen that China is paying more and more attention to the movement sports, and the development of the movement is becoming more and more important. From the data in Table 4, it can be seen that 50 ice and snow sports enthusiasts believe that the favorable influence of ice and snow sports is that people can understand the ice and snow culture and make it inheritable. This can improve people‚Äôs physical fitness and is conducive to healthy development.",

         "Networks are a key source of social capital for achieving goals in professional and personal settings. Yet, despite the clear benefits of having an extensive network, individuals often shy away from the opportunity to create new connections because engaging in instrumental networking can make them feel morally impure. In this article, we explore how the motives people have when engaging in networking impact these feelings and, as result, change how frequently they engage in networking and their job performance. Across a correlational survey study, a laboratory experiment (with samples from the United States and Italy), two online studies, an organizational network survey study, and a field experiment with professionals (total N = 2,551), we examine how self-regulatory focus, whether promotion or prevention, affects people's experience of and outcomes from networking. We find that a promotion focus, as compared to a prevention focus or a control condition, is beneficial to professional networking, as it lowers feelings of moral impurity from instrumental networking. As such, networking with a promotion focus increases the frequency of instrumental networking as compared to a control condition, whereas networking with a prevention focus decreases frequency of instrumental networking as compared to a control condition.

         "Objective. To offer new prognostic evaluations by exploring potentially distinctive genetic features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Methods. There were 12 samples for gene expression profiling processes in this study. These included three HCC lesion samples and their matched adjacent nontumor liver tissues obtained from patients with HCC, as well as three ICC samples and their controls collected similarly. In addition to the expression matrix generated on our own, profiles of other cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were also employed in later bioinformatical analyses. Differential analyses, functional analyses, protein interaction network analyses, and gene set variation analyses were used to identify key genes. To establish the prognostic models, univariate/multivariate Cox analyses and subsequent stepwise regression were applied, with the Akaike information criterion evaluating the goodness of fitness. Results. The top three pathways enriched in HCC were all metabolism-related; they were fatty acid degradation, retinol metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism. In ICC, on the other hand, additional pathways related to fat digestion and absorption and cholesterol metabolism were identified. Consistent characteristics of such a metabolic landscape were observed across different cohorts. A prognostic risk score model for calculating HCC risk was constructed, consisting of ADH4, ADH6, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, and RDH16. This signature predicts the 3-year survival with an AUC area of 0.708 ( <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mn>95</a:mn> <a:mi>%</a:mi> <a:mtext>CI</a:mtext> <a:mo>=</a:mo> <a:mn>0.644</a:mn> </a:math> to 0.772). For calculating the risk of ICC, a prognostic risk score model was built upon the expression levels of CYP26A1, NAT2, and UGT2B10. This signature predicts the 3-year survival with an AUC area of 0.806 (95% <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <c:mtext>CI</c:mtext> <c:mo>=</c:mo> <c:mn>0.664</c:mn> </c:math> to 0.947). Conclusion. HCC and ICC share commonly abrupted pathways associated with the metabolism of fatty acids, retinol, arachidonic acids, and drugs, indicating similarities in their pathogenesis as primary liver cancers. On the flip side, these two types of cancer possess distinctive promising biomarkers for predicting overall survival or potential targeted therapies.",

SD rats with T2DM were divided into a T2DM group ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>n</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>6</mn> </math> ) and DAPA group ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>n</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>6</mn> </math> ). They were, respectively, fed with the same amount of normal saline and 1 mg/kg DAPA. The control group ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <mi>n</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>6</mn> </math> ) was also fed with normal saline. The hearts were tested by the application of echocardiography and hemodynamics. Subsequently, fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) as well as interleukin- (IL-) 10, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ± in serum were tested. H&amp;E and Masson staining was performed to observe the degree of cardiac tissue lesions, and expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), calpain-1, p-IŒ∫BŒ±, and p65 in myocardial tissue was tested by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results. Compared with the control group, rats in the T2DM group exhibited significant diabetic symptoms: FBG was significantly elevated, and the levels of TC, TG, IL-6, and TNF-Œ± were significantly increased, while the levels of IL-10 and the calpain activity were evidently decreased. However, DAPA treatment could improve the above changes. At the same time, the damage and fibrosis of the heart tissue in the DAPA group were markedly improved. Additionally, the mRNA expression of ANP and BNP in myocardial tissue of the DAPA group was markedly increased. And DAPA could inhibit the expression of p-IŒ∫BŒ±/IŒ∫BŒ± in the cytoplasm and p65 in the nucleus as well as the expression of calpain-1 in myocardial tissue. Conclusion. DAPA treatment ameliorates the cardiac hypertrophy caused by T2DM by decreasing body blood glucose, while reducing the expression of calpain-1 in cardiomyocytes and inhibiting the nuclear translocation of NF-Œ∫B.",

         "The construction industry is a labor-intensive industry in China. Due to the unsaturation of pore gas, the unsaturation of soil mechanical properties is more complicated than saturation. Changes in water and gas will cause changes in soil attractiveness, which will further affect the mechanical properties and permeability of the soil, and even threaten the stability of the slope. Therefore, in order to study such engineering problems, it is necessary to comprehensively and correctly understand the changes of unsaturated soils during the drying and wetting cycles, and to investigate the reasons for the changes in order to scientifically analyze the stress state of unsaturated soils. Because of the continuous advancement of technology, people's comfort requirements for the function, appearance, and structure of buildings are also constantly improving. Especially in some modern large-scale construction projects, due to the large number of contractors, the amount of information that needs to be analyzed in the construction process is compared. The requirements for large and project engineering management are getting higher and higher, which makes the difficulty of the project greatly increased. Relying on traditional information communication and management methods, project cost management becomes difficult. Project cost management is one of the core contents of project management, and its management effect directly affects the final value of the project. On the basis of the continuous improvement of management ideas and theories in manufacturing management activities, project cost management introduces BIM technology currently active in the construction industry. Based on the characteristics of BIM core technology and BIM model software, it carries out in-depth research, explores the connection between BIM Technology and project cost management, and constructs the fine management mode of project cost.",

         "The purpose of this work was to extract key players such as mRNAs and long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) in the etiopathogenesis of osteosarcoma (OS). The sequencing analyses (mRNAs and lncRNAs) of OS were conducted followed by differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs (DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs) identification between U-2OS cells with has-miR-590-5p overexpression and negative control cells. Following this, the co-expression and functional enrichment analyses of DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs were carried out. Also, the miRNAs-DElncRNAs-DEmRNAs regulatory network was constructed with DElncRNAs-miRNAs and DElncRNAs-DEmRNAs pairs after the target gene analysis of miRNA. In addition, the ceRNA-has-miR-590-5p was further extracted based on the has-miR-590-5p-DElncRNAs and DElncRNAs-DEmRNAs interactions. Finally, the results of the bioinformatics analysis was verified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Totally, 980 DEmRNAs (539 up-regulated DEmRNAs and 441 down-regulated DEmRNAs) and 682 DElncRNAs (352 up-regulated DElncRNAs and 330 down-regulated DElncRNAs) were extracted between cells with hsa-miR-590-5p overexpression and normal cells. The functional analyses suggested that up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in several GO terms such as signal transduction and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway while down-regulated genes (SCUBE3, HIST1H4E and EDIL3) were associated with calcium ion binding, cell surface function and nucleosome assembly. Additionally, the miRNAs-DEmRNAs-DEmRNAs network represented 220 pairs among 41 miRNAs, 38 DElncRNAs and 61 DEmRNAs. Furthermore, the ceRNA-hsa-miR-590-5p network consisted of 70 interaction pairs including hsa-miR-590-5p-SCUBE3-CTB-113D17.1, hsa-miR-590-5p-EDIL3-CTB-113D17.1 and hsa-miR-590-5p-HIST1H4E-CTB-113D17.1) among hsa-miR-590-5p, 30 DEmRNAs and 4 down-regulated DElncRNAs. Meanwhile, the RT-PCR results incidated that compared with the blank (KB) and negative control (NC) group, the mRNA expression of SCUBE3, HIST1H4E, and EDIL3 were significantly descreased in mimics group (P value <0.05). The lncRNA CTB-113D17.1 might implicate with OS development probably via serving as a hsa-miR-590-5p sponge to regulate gene targets (SCUBE3, EDIL3 and HIST1H4E), which will facilitate the deep understandings of OS progression.",

         "Objective. Preterm infants (PTIs) are prone to respiratory failure or other diseases due to immature organ development and poor immunological function. Herein, the effects of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) on the immunological and pulmonary functions of PTIs during breastfeeding were investigated in this study. Methods. The study recruited 86 delivery women and their PTIs with preterm pregnancy outcomes, consisting of 46 cases receiving breastfeeding plus KMC intervention (KMC group) and 40 cases receiving breastfeeding plus routine care (control group). The time of first lactation, time of first breastfeeding, and duration of first breastfeeding were observed in both cohorts. The breastfeeding status was assessed using the LATCH system. Maternal psychological status was evaluated by the breastfeeding self-efficacy scale (BSES) and self-rating anxiety/depression scale (SAS/SDS). The growth and development of PTIs were recorded, and the levels of postalbumin (PA), transferrin (TRF), plasma albumin (ALB), immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgG, IgM, and complement C3 and C4 were measured. The tidal volume (VT), tidal volume per kilogram (VT/kg), minute volume (MV), and minute volume per kilogram (MV/kg) were detected using a pulmonary function tester. Results. The KMC group presented shorter time of first lactation and first breastfeeding than the control group, with longer duration of first breastfeeding ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). After intervention, the BSES scores of delivery women were increased, while the SAS and SDS scores were decreased, with more notable improvements in the KMC group ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). The levels of PA, TRF, ALB, IgA, IgG, VT, and MV were elevated in PTIs in both groups, with more evident increase in the KMC group than in the control group ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). A better growth of PTIs was found in the KMC group than the control group ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>&lt;</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ). Conclusions. The study demonstrated that KMC intervention during breastfeeding could benefit PTIs specifically regarding their immunological and pulmonary functions.",

         "Emerging evidence has revealed that long noncoding RNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (lncRNA NEAT1) is implicated in the development of various cancers. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of NEAT1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. The expression of NEAT1, miR-296-5p and Calponin 2 (CNN2) was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot, respectively. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay or flow cytometry, respectively. Transwell assay was used to determine cell migration and invasion. The interaction between miR-296-5p and NEAT1 or CNN2 was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay. Huh7 cells transfected with sh-NEAT1 were used to establish the murine xenograft model. NEAT1 was elevated in HCC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of NEAT1 significantly inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro as well as tumor growth in vivo. NEAT1 was a sponge of miR-296-5p and remarkably reduced the level of miR-296-5p in HCC cells. Furthermore, NEAT1 silence significantly decreased the expression of CNN2, which was the direct target of miR-296-5p. Besides that, the tumor suppression caused by NEAT1 silence could be rescued by CNN2 restoration or miR-296-5p inhibition in vitro. Additionally, NEAT1 indirectly regulated CNN2 expression by competing to miR-296-5p in vitro and in vivo. LncRNA NEAT1 contributes to HCC progression by regulating miR-296-5p/CNN2 axis, providing a novel regulatory mechanism for HCC development and a promising therapeutic target for the HCC treatment.",

         "To assess the diagnostic value of ultrasound Superb Microvascular Imaging (SMI) and versus Doppler ultrasound (TCD) for microvascular structure and aerodynamic changes in vertebral artery dissection (VAD). In this paper, we firstly simulate the process of clinician recognition of vertebral artery dissection and propose a combination of a priori shape information of vertebral artery dissection and deep folly convolutional networks (DFCNs) for IVUS. In this paper, 15 patients with vertebral artery dissection confirmed by SMI, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), or computed tomography angiography (CTA) from 2020 to 2021 were selected, and the true and false lumen diameters, peak systolic flow velocity (PSV), end-diastolic flow velocity (EDV) and PSV, EDV, and plasticity index (PI) of the intracranial vertebral artery were measured. Among the 15 patients with VAD, 4 (27%, 4/15) had trauma-induced secondary vertebral artery entrapment and 11 (73%, 11/15) had spontaneous entrapment without a clear cause. According to the structural characteristics of the vessels, there were 11 cases (73%, 11/15) of double-lumen, intramural hematoma, and vertebral artery dissection aneurysm, and 11 cases (73%, 11/15) of V1 segment. SMI not only provides an objective assessment of the vascular morphology and aerodynamic changes in VAD but also, in combination with TCD, can further determine the opening of the traffic branches in the posterior circulation, providing reliable information for the early diagnosis and treatment of microvascular dissection of the vertebral artery.",

         "The purpose of this study is to examine the main challenges that these entrepreneurs in developing nations confront. This study utilizes a digital startup database maintained by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship (MoDEE) in Jordan and conducts semi-structured interviews with a random selection of 85 early-stage digital entrepreneurs. In order to understand the cognitive and psychological characteristics of digital entrepreneurs and their motives for entering the field, this study draws on the theory of planned behavior. Using NVivo 20, a theme analysis is carried out. Based on the interviews conducted, the top industries among the startups that were looked at were big data and business analytics, internet-of-things (IoT), cybersecurity (CT) technology, food service and agri-tech, warehouse automation (WA) and elastic logistics (ELs), conversional artificial intelligence (CAI), financial technology (FinTech), and block chain technology (BCT). 42.5 % of the target population is represented by the large sample size that was used. These obstacles could include long-term funding, a dearth of one-on-one coaching and guidance, unforeseen risks or setbacks, and financial constraints. The study's conclusions may provide policymakers with a tactical manual for removing the main barriers that emerging digital entrepreneurs and their firms must overcome.",

         "Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are major risk factors for vascular complications. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) derived from db/db mice, an established mouse model of type 2 diabetes, displayed enhanced inflammatory gene expression and proatherogenic responses. We examined the hypothesis that aberrant epigenetic chromatin events may the underlying mechanism for this persistent dysfunctional behavior and \"memory\" of the diabetic cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that levels of histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2), a key chromatin mark associated with active gene expression, were significantly elevated at the promoters of the inflammatory genes monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-6 in db/db VSMCs relative to db/+ cells. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced inflammatory gene expression, H3K4me2 levels, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II at the gene promoters were also enhanced in db/db VSMCs, demonstrating the formation of open chromatin poised for transcriptional activation in diabetes. On the other hand, protein levels of lysine-specific demethylase1 (LSD1), which negatively regulates H3K4 methylation and its occupancy at these gene promoters, were significantly reduced in db/db VSMCs. High glucose (25 mmol/L) treatment of human VSMCs also increased inflammatory genes with parallel increases in promoter H3K4me2 levels and reduced LSD1 recruitment. LSD1 gene silencing with small interfering RNAs significantly increased inflammatory gene expression and enhanced VSMC-monocyte binding in nondiabetic VSMCs. In contrast, overexpression of LSD1 in diabetic db/db VSMCs inhibited their enhanced inflammatory gene expression. These results demonstrate novel functional roles for LSD1 and H3K4 methylation in VSMCs and inflammation. Dysregulation of their actions may be a major mechanism for vascular inflammation and metabolic memory associated with diabetic complications.",

         "Abstract The Arabidopsis Ler-RPP27 gene confers AtSgt1b-independent resistance to downy mildew (Peronospora parasitica) isolate Hiks1. The RPP27 locus was mapped to a four-bacterial artificial chromosome interval on chromosome 1 from genetic analysis of a cross between the enhanced susceptibility mutant Col-edm1 (Col-sgt1) and Landsberg erecta (Ler-0). A Cf-like candidate gene in this interval was PCR amplified from Ler-0 and transformed into mutant Col-rpp7.1 plants. Homozygous transgenic lines conferred resistance to Hiks1 and at least four Ler-0 avirulent/Columbia-0 (Col-0) virulent isolates of downy mildew pathogen. A full-length RPP27 cDNA was isolated, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences showed that the gene encodes a receptor-like protein (RLP) with a distinct domain structure, composed of a signal peptide followed by extracellular Leu-rich repeats, a membrane spanning region, and a short cytoplasmic carboxyl domain. RPP27 is the first RLP-encoding gene to be implicated in disease resistance in Arabidopsis, enabling the deployment of Arabidopsis techniques to investigate the mechanisms of RLP function. Homology searches of the Arabidopsis genome, using the RPP27, Cf-9, and Cf-2 protein sequences as a starting point, identify 59 RLPs, including the already known CLAVATA2 and TOO MANY MOUTHS genes. A combination of sequence and phylogenetic analysis of these predicted RLPs reveals conserved structural features of the family.",

SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibodies were detected in 111 of 959 (11.6%) individuals, starting from September 2019 (14%), with a cluster of positive cases (&gt;30%) in the second week of February 2020 and the highest number (53.2%) in Lombardy. This study shows an unexpected very early circulation of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic individuals in Italy several months before the first patient was identified, and clarifies the onset and spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Finding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in asymptomatic people before the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy may reshape the history of pandemic.",

         "Aseev launched a new branch of functional analysis by introducing the theory of quasilinear spaces in the framework of the topics of norm, bounded quasilinear operators and functionals (Aseev (1986)). Furthermore, some quasilinear counterparts of classical nonlinear analysis that lead to such result as Frechet derivative and its applications were examined deal with. This pioneering work causes a lot of results in such applications such as (Rojas-Medar et al. (2005), Talo and Ba≈üar (2010), and Nikol'skiƒ≠ (1993)). His work has motivated us to introduce the concept of quasilinear inner product spaces. Thanks to this new notion, we obtain some new theorems and definitions which are quasilinear counterparts of fundamental definitions and theorems in linear functional analysis. We claim that some new results related to this concept provide an important contribution to the improvement of quasilinear functional analysis.",

Here, the six domains of the 23S ribosomal RNA were individually synthesized and shown to be capable, when complexed together, of stimulating the reaction. Omission and addition experiments indicated that the activity could be reconstituted solely by domain V at a concentration 10 times higher than that of the intact 23S ribosomal RNA, whereas domain VI could enhance the activity in trans.

         "In recent years, there have been a number of epistemological developments in social work. Further, there have been a number of theoretical approaches that have attempted to ground the concept of 'power' to understand organizational practice such as Marxist thought. At the same time, the insights of French social theorist Michel Foucault have been captivating to the disciplinary development of social work in illuminating power relations and subject positioning between helping professions and clients. To move beyond this, and in order to theoretically interrogate the relationship between social theory and professional power, this article draws from the neo Foucauldian-Feminist philosopher Judith Butler ‚Äì especially regarding Butler's (1990, 1993 and 1998) powerful work on 'performativity'. This article attempts to generate new theoretical insights to understanding contemporary social work through the conceptual tools of Butler.",

         "The concept of fuzzy graph (FG) and its generalized forms has been developed to cope with several real-life problems having some sort of imprecision like networking problems, decision making, shortest path problems, and so on. This paper is based on some developments in generalization of FG theory to deal with situation where imprecision is characterized by four types of membership grades. A novel concept of T-spherical fuzzy graph (TSFG) is proposed as a common generalization of FG, intuitionistic fuzzy graph (IFG), and picture fuzzy graph (PFG) based on the recently introduced concept of T-spherical fuzzy set (TSFS). The significance and novelty of proposed concept is elaborated with the help of some examples, graphical analysis, and results. Some graph theoretic terms are defined and their properties are studied. Specially, the famous Dijkstra algorithm is proposed in the environment of TSFGs and is applied to solve a shortest path problem. The comparative analysis of the proposed concept and existing theory is made. In addition, the advantages of the proposed work are discussed over the existing tools.",

         "Because of its high availability, Internet of Things technology is widely used in multipoint ecological environment monitoring and other related fields, which greatly improves the scientificity and accuracy of ecological environment monitoring results. The Internet of Things technology can realize multilevel and omnidirectional environmental monitoring functions by combining GPS systems and GIS systems and, at the same time, can significantly increase the monitoring range of environmental monitoring. On the basis of the Internet of Things monitoring technology, the use of electronic sensors can track and monitor the content and composition of various elements in the environment in real time, thereby reducing the work intensity of environmental monitoring personnel and effectively improving the environment reliability of monitoring results. In this study, we introduce the actual application and direction of the Internet of Things technology in multisite environmental monitoring systems. A water quality pH and temperature sensor monitoring system based on wireless data transmission is designed. Experimental analysis shows that the communication stability of the designed sensor system is relatively good. The average packet loss rate of the network is only 0.87%. The value measured by the designed sensor is very close to the reference value measured by the standard instrument. The average relative error of pH and temperature is 1.56% and 0.77%, respectively, which meets the water quality environmental monitoring standards. It is believed that the use of Internet of Things technology in ecological environment monitoring can effectively solve the problems of low efficiency and low rationality in traditional environmental monitoring methods, thereby fully improving the quality and level of monitoring in ecological environment monitoring.",

DAAs consistently demonstrate higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates and better safety profiles across various patient populations, including those with cirrhosis and treatment-experienced individuals. The studies included highlight the superior efficacy of DAAs, with fewer adverse events such as anemia and fatigue, making them more tolerable and suitable for long-term treatment. These findings reinforce the clinical importance of DAAs as the standard of care for managing hepatitis C virus (HCV), particularly in special populations. Although interferon-based therapies remain relevant in resource-limited settings, this review emphasizes the need for broader access to DAAs to improve global health outcomes and reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality.",

         "Objective. The aim is to investigate the efficiency and outcome of robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) in a cohort of patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in our Gynecology Department. Methods. We performed a retrospective study of female patients who underwent RASC in Chinese PLA General Hospital from January 2013 to December 2020. Their clinical features included age, degree of prolapse, menopause time, body mass index, pregnancy, delivery, operation time, and bleeding volume. All patients were followed up for more than 6 months. POP-Q was recorded to evaluate the position of prolapsed organs. PFDI-20, PFIQ-7, and PGI-I were used to evaluate the life quality after surgery. Results. Twenty-four patients with POP received RASC in our center. The intraoperative bleeding was 86.9 ¬± 98.3 ml (20‚Äì300 ml). The operation time was 143.5 ¬± 47.3 min (60‚Äì240 minutes). The hospitalization time was 10.4 ¬± 2.1 days (8‚Äì16 days). And the follow-up time was 40.8 ¬± 22.0 months (6‚Äì72 months). In the POP-Q follow-up, postoperative Aa, Ba, Ap, Bp, and C were significantly improved than those before surgery ( <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mi>P</a:mi> <a:mo>&lt;</a:mo> <a:mn>0.05</a:mn> </a:math> ). The objective and subjective cure rate was 100%. PGI-I score was very good in 9 (9/24), very good in 10 (10/24), and good in 3 (3/24). Postoperative PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 were 2.78 ¬± 3.82 and 1.57 ¬± 3.86, which decreased dramatically after surgery ( <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <c:mi>P</c:mi> <c:mo>&lt;</c:mo> <c:mn>0.05</c:mn> </c:math> ). Mesh exposure occurred in 4 cases (16.7%) at 2‚Äì12 months. The exposed diameters were less than 1 cm in 3 cases (2 A/T3/S1) and 1-2 cm in 1 case (3 B/T3/S1). These mesh exposures healed after conservative observation or mesh excision. Conclusion. RASC for POP has the advantage of less bleeding and hospitalization time. It is a minimally invasive option for pelvic organ prolapse.",

A total of 372 tissue samples (three from each fish) comprising liver, intestine and kidney were collected from 124 fish (Clarias gariepinus and Oreochromis niloticus). Distribution of E. tarda infection among these three organs examined indicated that E. tarda was isolated most frequently from liver (6.5%) followed by intestine (2.4%) and kidney (0.8%) with significant difference. Statistical significant differences (p < 0.05) were found in E. tarda infection with respect to tissue samples. Fish from Lake Zeway was prevalently infected by E. tarda than Lake Langano. Male fish were more frequently harbor E. tarda than female fish and were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The current study is signified that E. tarda infection is a potential threat to the fishery sector and public health. Therefore, awareness should be created on the hazardousness of E. tarda on public health significance and hence further studies have to be conducted in other lakes of Ethiopia that harbor fishes.",

         "Summary Objective Progestins are commonly prescribed for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and contraception. However, the effects of progestins on bone metabolism remain unclear and are often controversial. Design and patients This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that progestins with no significant glucocorticoid activity may be a better choice for HRT to achieve increased beneficial effects on bone metabolism than progestins with strong glucocorticoid activity. A total of 104 postmenopausal women aged 50‚Äì75 years with osteoporosis were allocated randomly to three groups: (1) conjugated oestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (HRT‚ÄêMPA, with significant glucocorticoid activity); (2) conjugated oestrogen plus norethisterone (HRT‚ÄêNET, with no significant glucocorticoid activity); and (3) control (no treatment). Measurements Vertebral X‚Äêrays and bone mineral density (BMD) at distal 1/3 radius were assessed at baseline and every 6 months during the 2‚Äêyear study period, along with markers of bone turnover. The occurrence of new nonvertebral fractures was identified by X‚Äêray. Results After the 2‚Äêyear treatment, mean BMD changes relative to baseline in the HRT‚ÄêMPA, HRT‚ÄêNET and control groups were 1¬∑6%, 2¬∑3% and ‚Äì1¬∑9%, respectively. In addition, the rate of increase in HRT‚ÄêNET was significantly greater than that in HRT‚ÄêMPA ( P = 0¬∑019). The incidence of new fractures during the 2‚Äêyear treatment in the control group was 26% (9/34). HRT‚ÄêNET treatment significantly inhibited the occurrence of new fractures (RR 0¬∑14, 95% CI 0¬∑02‚Äì0¬∑93, P = 0¬∑04), while HRT‚ÄêMPA treatment failed to show a statistically significant reduction (RR 0¬∑41, 95% CI 0¬∑14‚Äì1¬∑24, P = 0¬∑11). Both HRT‚ÄêMPA and HRT‚ÄêNET treatments significantly decreased serum osteocalcin levels by 29¬∑4% and 23¬∑5%, respectively, after 6 months of treatment, with the decrease in HRT‚ÄêMPA being significantly greater than that in HRT‚ÄêNET ( P = 0¬∑042). Conclusions These findings suggest that progestins with no significant glucocorticoid activity may be a better choice for HRT, resulting in increased beneficial effects on bone metabolism compared with progestins with strong glucocorticoid activity.",

         "With the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce, however, logistics has become a bottleneck in the development of cross-border electricity traders. The results of studies on cross-border e-commerce logistics are still less, and the relevant theoretical studies are not yet mature enough. As cross-border e-commerce occupies a share of foreign trade in foreign trade increases, so does their influence. In order to eliminate bottlenecks in the cross-border logistics of an electric enterprise, it is of great importance to systematically study the issues of synergy in the logistics of the supply chain of a cross-border electric enterprise and validate how cross-border traders and cross-border logistics work together using cross-border discussion based on the perspective of cross-border e-commerce ecosystem. At the same time, an analysis of the need for cross-border logistics collaboration electricity traders and cross-border logistics is being carried out, as well as an in-depth study of synergy mechanisms between cross-border electricity traders and cross-border logistics based on a cross-border ecosystem perspective. The empirical results show that cross-border logistics is available function service capability; cross-border logistics information sharing level, cross-border logistics resource optimization and allocation capability, and the opening level of cross-border logistics environment have different contributions to the impact on the efficiency of cross-border e-commerce logistics. Among them, the level of cross-border logistics information exchange has the most significant influence on the logistics efficiency of cross-border traders, followed by cross-border logistics functional services capabilities, again the level of openness of the cross-border logistics environment, and finally, the ability to optimally distribute cross-border logistics resources.",

         "To compare the value of a hepatectomy and hemangioma stripping on patients with giant hepatic hemangiomas.Seventy-four patients with giant hepatic hemangiomas were retrospectively analyzed from data collected from their hepatobiliary surgeries performed from June 2010 to June 2015 at the People's Hospital of Ningxia and the general hospital affiliated with Ningxia Medical University. The patients were divided into a hepatectomy group (37 patients) and a hemangioma-stripping group (37 patients). Conditions of each group were compared before and after surgery and comprised of surgery duration, intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, duration of hepatic blood occlusion, and hospital stay. Any complications after surgery, such as pleural effusions, bile leakage, and abdominal hemorrhage, were also observed.In the hemangioma-stripping group, the surgery time was 2.38 ¬± 0.93 h, intraoperative blood loss was 889.19 ¬± 756.37, blood transfusion amount was 723.78 ¬± 801.14, the duration of hepatic blood occlusion 26.84 ¬± 17.30 min, and hospital stay was 16.19 ¬± 5.01 d. In the hepatectomy group, surgery time was 3.26 ¬± 1.16 h, intraoperative blood loss was 1551.35 ¬± 1755.88 mL blood transfusion amount was 1693.24 ¬± 2117.72 mL, duration of hepatic blood occlusion was 26.84 ¬± 17.30 min, and hospital stay was 16.19 ¬± 5.01 d. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The pleural effusion incident rate in the former group was lower than that of the latter group, and the difference was statistically significant.Hemangiomas stripping is an effective method by which to cure hepatic hemangioma, with the advantages being a relatively easy surgery with less patient trauma, rapid recovery, and fewer complications. This method should be used more often in clinical settings.",

         "Doxorubicin (DOX) has been widely recognized as effective in anticancer therapy; however, the additional organ toxicity and low targeting of DOX in antitumor activity remains unaddressed. The aim of this study was to use the drug carrier dextran/polylactic acid (DEX/PLA) and paramagnetic Fe3O4 to improve the targeting of DOX in liver cancer treatment while reducing its potential organ toxicity. Our experimental results show that the combination drug (Fe3O4@DEX/PLA-DOX) exhibits strong hepatocarcinogenic inhibition and low cytotoxicity and that this modified drug provides a better option for clinical liver cancer treatment.",

         "An Effective and Lightweight Deep Electrocardiography Arrhythmia Recognition Model Using Novel Special and Native Structural Regularization Techniques on Cardiac Signal",
         "Recently, cardiac arrhythmia recognition from electrocardiography (ECG) with deep learning approaches is becoming popular in clinical diagnosis systems due to its good prognosis findings, where expert data preprocessing and feature engineering are not usually required. But a lightweight and effective deep model is highly demanded to face the challenges of deploying the model in real-life applications and diagnosis accurately. In this work, two effective and lightweight deep learning models named Deep-SR and Deep-NSR are proposed to recognize ECG beats, which are based on two-dimensional convolution neural networks (2D CNNs) while using different structural regularizations. First, 97720 ECG beats extracted from all records of a benchmark MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset have been transformed into 2D RGB (red, green, and blue) images that act as the inputs to the proposed 2D CNN models. Then, the optimization of the proposed models is performed through the proper initialization of model layers, on-the-fly augmentation, regularization techniques, Adam optimizer, and weighted random sampler. Finally, the performance of the proposed models is evaluated by a stratified 5-fold cross-validation strategy along with callback features. The obtained overall accuracy of recognizing normal beat and three arrhythmias (V-ventricular ectopic, S-supraventricular ectopic, and F-fusion) based on the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) is 99.93%, and 99.96% for the proposed Deep-SR model and Deep-NSR model, which demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed models has surpassed the state-of-the-art models and also expresses the higher model generalization. The received results with model size suggest that the proposed CNN models especially Deep-NSR could be more useful in wearable devices such as medical vests, bracelets for long-term monitoring of cardiac conditions, and in telemedicine to accurate diagnose the arrhythmia from ECG automatically. As a result, medical costs of patients and work pressure on physicians in medicals and clinics would be reduced effectively.",

    "**Final Data Matching Strategy for Control Group Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final strategy for generating the control group of non-retracted papers is a hierarchical matching cascade, designed for robustness and to maximize data retention. This approach is superior to previous iterations as it is based on our direct debugging of the OpenAlex API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan: For each retracted paper (a \"case\"), we will attempt to find a non-retracted \"twin\" by querying the API in a specific, prioritized order. As soon as a twin is found, we record its match quality and move to the next case. The *publication_year* and a*rticle_type* are mandatory for all levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matching Cascade:\n",
    "- **Level 1 (Quality:** *Source_and_Country*): Match on *source_id*, *first_author_country*, *article_type*, and *year*.\n",
    "- **Level 2 (Quality:** *Source_Only*): If Level 1 fails, match on *source_id*, *article_type*, and *year*.\n",
    "- **Level 3 (Quality:** *Country_Only*): If prior levels fail (e.g., due to a missing *source_id*), match on *first_author_country*, *article_type*, and *year*.\n",
    "- **Level 4 (Quality:** *Type_Only*): As a final fallback, match only on *article_type* and *year*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of this approach:\n",
    "1. **Uses a Unique Identifier:** The *source_id* is a much more reliable key than text-based names like publisher or journal, preventing mismatches.\n",
    "2. **Controls for the True \"Source\":** Matching on *source_id* ensures we are comparing papers from the exact same journal or conference, which is an excellent proxy for editorial standards and quality control.\n",
    "3. **Simple and Defensible:** The logic is clear, evidence-based from our API testing, and methodologically sound. It gives us the flexibility to filter by match quality during the modeling phase."

Bang-Bang is adopted to reduce big error rapidly. Fuzzy and integral control enhances robustness of the controller, and eliminate steady-state-error completely. Integral coefficient is changed by a subordinate fuzzy controller online. As a result, Integral has faintly negative effect on system dynamic qualities, and eliminates steady-state-error fast. Using genetic algorithm to optimize scaling factors of main fuzzy controller offline in order to improve control performance. Finally, simulate analysis was made on MATLAB integrated plat. The result shows that the proposed controller has strong robustness, excellent dynamic and static index. It can satisfy control demand of the concerned system completely.",

         "Abstract Aim The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an individualized nomogram to predict venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in hospitalized postoperative breast cancer patients. Design A single‚Äêcentral retrospective and non‚Äêinterventional trial. Methods For model development, we used data from 4,755 breast cancer patients between 1 November 2016‚Äì30 June 2018 (3,310 patients in the development group and 1,445 in the validation group). Overall, 216 patients developed VTE (150 in development group and 66 in validation group). The model was validated by receiver operating characteristic curves and the calibration plot. The clinical utility of the model was determined through decision curve analysis. Results The individualized nomogram consisted of six clinical factors: age, body mass index, number of cardiovascular comorbidities, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical treatment, hospital length of stay and two pre‚Äêoperative biomarkers of Homocysteine and D‚Äêdimer. The model at the 3.9% optimal cut‚Äêoff had the area under the curve of 0.854 (95% CI, 0.824‚Äì0.884) and 0.805 (95% CI, 0.740‚Äì0.870) in the development and validation groups. A p = 0.570 of the calibration test showed that the model was well‚Äêcalibrated. The net benefit of the model was better between threshold probabilities of 5%‚Äì30% in decision curve analysis. Conclusion The nomogram of VTE risk assessment, is applicable to hospitalized postoperative breast cancer patients. However, multi‚Äêcentral prospective studies are needed to improve and validate the model. Effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in high‚Äêrisk patients are needed to demonstrate in interventional trials. Impact This nomogram can be used in clinical to inform practice of physicians and nurses to predict the VTE probability and maybe direct personalized decision making for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized postoperative breast cancer patients.",

         "CR technology enables CR users the capability to share the wireless channel with licensed users in an opportunistic manner. In cognitive network, once the primary user appears on the spectrum during the entire communication of the CR user, the CR user has to vacate the channel and switch to another one. In this paper, a Spectrum Decision based on Up-Time Ratio of spectrum (SDUTR) is presented, which puts key focus on reducing collision on the licensed spectrum between the primary user and the secondary one. Moreover, the SDUTR algorithm can be operated over heterogeneous spectrum bands. Simulations show that total broadcasting delay and information redundancy of the network are reduced as compared to selective broadcasting <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">[7]</sup> .",

         "Abstract Aim The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an individualized nomogram to predict venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in hospitalized postoperative breast cancer patients. Design A single‚Äêcentral retrospective and non‚Äêinterventional trial. Methods For model development, we used data from 4,755 breast cancer patients between 1 November 2016‚Äì30 June 2018 (3,310 patients in the development group and 1,445 in the validation group). Overall, 216 patients developed VTE (150 in development group and 66 in validation group). The model was validated by receiver operating characteristic curves and the calibration plot. The clinical utility of the model was determined through decision curve analysis. Results The individualized nomogram consisted of six clinical factors: age, body mass index, number of cardiovascular comorbidities, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical treatment, hospital length of stay and two pre‚Äêoperative biomarkers of Homocysteine and D‚Äêdimer. The model at the 3.9% optimal cut‚Äêoff had the area under the curve of 0.854 (95% CI, 0.824‚Äì0.884) and 0.805 (95% CI, 0.740‚Äì0.870) in the development and validation groups. A p = 0.570 of the calibration test showed that the model was well‚Äêcalibrated. The net benefit of the model was better between threshold probabilities of 5%‚Äì30% in decision curve analysis. Conclusion The nomogram of VTE risk assessment, is applicable to hospitalized postoperative breast cancer patients. However, multi‚Äêcentral prospective studies are needed to improve and validate the model. Effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in high‚Äêrisk patients are needed to demonstrate in interventional trials. Impact This nomogram can be used in clinical to inform practice of physicians and nurses to predict the VTE probability and maybe direct personalized decision making for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized postoperative breast cancer patients.",

         "Abstract Background and Aims The COVID‚Äê19 pandemic has changed people's lifestyles as well as the way healthcare services are delivered. Undoubtedly, the difficulties associated with COVID‚Äê19 infection and rehabilitation and those associated with quarantine and viral preventive efforts may exacerbate the need for virtual reality to be used as a part of a complete rehabilitation strategy for these individuals. Thus, the present research aimed to evaluate the potential uses of virtual reality for the rehabilitation of individuals suffering from COVID‚Äê19. Methods From 2019 to March 1, 2022, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cochran Library, Scopus, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases. The papers were selected based on search terms and those that discussed the use of virtual reality in the rehabilitation of COVID‚Äê19 patients were reviewed. Each step of the study was reviewed by two authors. Results A total of 699 papers were found during the first search. Three papers were chosen for further investigation after a thorough evaluation of the publications' titles, abstracts, and full texts. Cross‚Äêsectional studies, randomized controlled clinical trials, and case reports comprised 33%, 33%, and 33% of the publications, respectively. Based on the results, people suffering from COVID‚Äê19 were the focus of two papers (66%) that employed immersion virtual reality for cognitive rehabilitation, whereas one study (33%) used non‚Äêimmersive virtual reality for physical rehabilitation. In two papers (66%), virtual reality was also offered to patients in the form of a game. Conclusion According to the results of the present research, virtual reality games may enhance functional and cognitive consequences, contentment levels among patients, and their ability to take charge of their own health care. In light of the obstacles faced by COVID‚Äê19 patients, alterations in the delivery of healthcare, and the significance of rehabilitation in this group during quarantine, new techniques have been considered for these patients to maintain treatment, return to regular life, and enhance their standard of life.",

         "Abstract Tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) microscopy is a promising technique for use in surface analysis, allowing both topographic and spectroscopic information to be obtained simultaneously at a scale below 10 nm. One proposed method to further improve spatial resolution is the use of propagating surface plasmons as an excitation light source (i.e., remote excitation). However, this requires a specialized tip that can only be fabricated via expensive procedures, such as electron-beam lithography. Here, we propose a new method for fabricating silver nanowire-based tips that are suitable for remote excitation-TERS, removing the need for such techniques. A silver nanowire was fixed onto a tungsten-tip using a micromanipulator, before gold nanoparticles were attached in a site-specific manner using AC-dielectrophoresis. All the processes were completed using an optical microscope in the ambient. The background intensities in TERS spectra were suppressed with remote excitation relative to the conventional excitation configuration, indicating an increase in TERS sensitivity.",

         "Next-generation tissue engineering exploits the body's own regenerative capacity by providing an optimal niche via a scaffold for the migration and subsequent proliferation of endogenous cells to the site of injury, enhancing regeneration and healing and bypassing laborious in vitro cell-culturing procedures. Such systems are also required to have a sufficient angiogenic capacity for the subsequent patency of implanted scaffolds. The exploitation of redox properties of nanodimensional ceria (nCeO2) in in situ tissue engineering to promote cell adhesion and angiogenesis is poorly investigated. As a novel strategy, electrospun polycaprolactone based tissue-engineering scaffolds loaded with nCeO2 were developed and evaluated for morphological and physicomechanical features. In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to show the ability of nCeO2-containing scaffolds to enhance cell adhesion and angiogenesis. These studies confirmed that nCeO2-containing scaffolds supported cell adhesion and angiogenesis better than bare scaffolds. Gene-expression studies had shown that angiogenesis-related factors such as HIF1Œ± and VEGF were up-regulated. Overall results show that incorporation of nCeO2 plays a key role in scaffolds for the enhancement of angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and cell proliferation and can produce a successful outcome in in situ tissue engineering.",

In order to make use of this asset, it is necessary to share expertise between staff as well as transfer expertise to industry. Expertise matching - locating experts with the specific expertise is receiving more and more attention since it facilitates people connection to each other. This paper proposes an ontology-based approach for expertise matching within an academic research environment. In our approach an expert ontology is used to integrate multiple expertise indications from heterogeneous data sources and domain ontology is used to replace keyword-based expertise profile to concept based expertise profile. An analysis of the prototype system indicates that ontology-based expertise matching supports users browsing and searching expertise more efficiently and effectively.",

         "With the rapid development of radio and computer technologies, the application scenarios of UAV carrying computer flight control systems are becoming more and more abundant. UAV can form a collaborative network with ground IoV (Internet of Vehicle) to improve the link quality of vehicle signals in some environments with poor network connectivity. For UAV and ground vehicles that are far apart, satellites can assist in the transmission of data between them. UAVs are allowed to be included in the satellite communication network in the Ka band in the 2015 World Radiocommunication Conference. In order to avoid the interference with existing communication services in the Ka band, it is necessary to limit the flying height of the UAV. This article will study the frequency compatibility between UAV and Internet of Vehicles in the same-frequency band. First, model the propagation environment of the UAV transmitting signal is modeled and the path loss of it is calculated, including the basic transmission loss in free space of the signal and the atmospheric propagation loss when the signal passes through the atmosphere. Then the radiation pattern of the receiving antenna is modeled, which is a 4 √ó 2 antenna array in this article, and the total antenna gain is obtained by adding the element gain and the array gain. Finally, the interference between UAV and Internet of Vehicles is simulated, calculating the interference and noise ratio of UAV to the Internet of Vehicles under different pointing angles between the interference and the interfered antenna and different elevation angles from UAV to the GSO satellite. Finally, the safe separation distance to protect the Internet of Vehicles from interference is got.",

         "PAR-2 (protease-activated receptor 2), a G-protein-coupled receptor activated by certain serine proteases such as trypsin and tryptase, is now considered a physiologically important molecule and also a novel target for drug development. PAR-2 is widely distributed in the mammalian body, especially throughout the alimentary system. PAR-2 plays various roles in the alimentary, circulatory, respiratory and neuronal systems. In the gastric mucosa, PAR-2 modulates multiple functions and exerts mucosal cytoprotection mainly by activating sensory neurons. Thus, PAR-2 would appear to be a therapeutic target for treatment of gastric mucosal injury. Agonists and/or antagonists for PAR-2 might also be applicable to the clinical treatment of patients with inflammatory diseases in other organs.",

Existing solutions still suffer from many vexatious problems, such as the need to maintain complex index structures and the unsatisfactory application of homomorphic schemes. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a multiuser ciphertext search scheme based on blockchain and SGX. Our scheme uses blockchain and SGX to protect keywords and data privacy and complete decryption and keywords search of ciphertext data which does not need pregenerated indexes or preselected keywords. Second, for a multiuser scenario, a smart contract is designed to verify authorization requests and manage multiple authorized users. Finally, we give security analysis, function comparison, and performance analysis to prove the security and feasibility of our scheme. Experiments show that our scheme has effectively met practical requirements.",

         "A rapidly growing literature has attempted to explain Donald Trump's success in the 2016 U.S. presidential election as a result of a wide variety of differences in individual characteristics, attitudes, and social processes.We propose that the economic and psychological processes previously established have in common that they generated or electorally capitalized on unhappiness in the electorate, which emerges as a powerful high-level predictor of the 2016 electoral outcome.Drawing on a large dataset covering over 2 million individual surveys, which we aggregated to the county level, we find that low levels of evaluative, experienced, and eudaemonic subjective well-being (SWB) are strongly predictive of Trump's victory, accounting for an extensive list of demographic, ideological, and socioeconomic covariates and robustness checks.County-level future life evaluation alone correlates with the Trump vote share over Republican baselines at r = -.78 in the raw data, a magnitude rarely seen in the social sciences.We show similar findings when examining the association between individual-level life satisfaction and Trump voting.Low levels of SWB also predict anti-incumbent voting at the 2012 election, both at the county and individual level.The findings suggest that SWB is a powerful high-level marker of (dis)content and that SWB should be routinely considered alongside economic explanations of electoral choice.",

         "Dysregulation of osteoclast-osteoblast balance, resulting in abnormal bone remodeling, is responsible for postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) or other secondary forms of osteoporosis. We demonstrated that dictamnine (DIC), a novel RANKL-targeted furoquinoline alkaloid, inhibits osteoclastogenesis by facilitating the activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS), NF-Œ∫B, and NFATc1 in vitro and prevents the development of OVX-induced osteoporosis mouse models in vivo. Methods. The docking mechanism of DIC and RANKL was initially identified by protein‚Äìligand molecular docking. RNA sequencing was performed and analyzed to reveal the potential mechanism and signaling pathway of the antiosteoporosis effects of DIC. To verify the sequencing results, we examined the impact of DIC on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption, F-actin ring production, ROS generation, and NF-Œ∫B activation in osteoclasts in vitro. Moreover, a luciferase assay was performed to determine the binding and transcriptional activity of Nrf2 and NF-Œ∫B. The in vivo efficacy of DIC was assessed with an ovariectomy- (OVX-) induced osteoporosis model, which was analyzed using micro-CT and bone histomorphometry. Results. The molecular docking results indicated that DIC could bind particularly to RANKL. RNA-seq confirmed that DIC could regulate the osteoclast-related pathway. DIC suppressed osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, F-actin belt formation, osteoclast-specific gene expression, and ROS activity by preventing NFATc1 expression and affecting NF-Œ∫B signaling pathways in vitro. The luciferase assay showed that DIC not only suppressed the activity of Nrf2 but also contributed to the combination of Nrf2 and NF-Œ∫B. Our in vivo study indicated that DIC protects against OVX-induced osteoporosis and preserves bone volume by inhibiting osteoclast activity and function. Conclusions. DIC can ameliorate osteoclast formation and OVX-induced osteoporosis and therefore is a potential therapeutic treatment for osteoporosis.",

         "Objective. To analyze the effect of painless rehabilitation nursing for hip replacement patients. Method. 124 elderly patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty in our hospital from June 2019 to June 2020 were selected as study subjects. They were randomly divided into observation group and control group. The control group was given routine nursing care, and the observation group was given painless rehabilitation care on the basis of the control group. Knee circumference, knee pain, knee function, agitation and sleep duration were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results. The changes of knee circumference diametral in both groups were significantly decreased at 1, 3 and 7 days after operation; The changes of knee circumference diametral in the observation group were significantly smaller than those in the control group at 3,7 days after operation (P &lt;0.05). VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) scores at 1, 3 and 7 d after operation were significantly decreased in both groups; The score of the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P &lt;0.05). HSS (Hospital for special surgery) scores increased significantly in both groups at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after operation. All the comparisons were statistically significant (P &lt;0.05); HSS scores of observation group were significantly higher than control group at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. The difference was statistically significant (P &lt;0.05). The agitation rate of the observation group was lower than that of the control group (P &lt;0.05). Compared with the control group, the sleep time of observation group increased significantly in each period, with statistically significant difference (P &lt;0.05). Conclusion. Perioperative painless rehabilitation nursing interventions for patients with hip replacement could significantly relieve swelling and pain, it was helpful for the patients to recover the function of knee joint after operation and worthy of clinical application.",

         "Abstract Using observations and descriptions of drilling cores, image logging, microscopic section, argon ion polishing field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and whole-rock trace element analysis, the study of shale reservoir diagenesis and space types in the Fengcheng Formation of the Mahu Sag was conducted. Considering the trace element contents and their ratios (Sr/Ba, V/Ni, Th/U, V/(V + Ni), U/Mo, and Sr/Cu), the Fengcheng Formation is formed in a dry and hot continental lacustrine basin with a paleoenvironment of saltwater and anoxic/lean oxygen conditions. The shale reservoirs of the Fengcheng Formation with the characteristic of multisource mixed sedimentation include terrigenous clastic, volcaniclastics, and carbonate rocks. Currently, the Fengcheng reservoir of the Mahu Sag is in the middle of diagenetic-stage B. The principal factors for reservoir densification are compaction, dissolution, carbonate mineral cementation, and clay mineral cementation. The Fengcheng Formation develops multiple reservoir storage space types, such as rock fractures, stylolites, and micro‚Äìnanoscale pore-throat systems. The macroreservoir space types include tectonic, induced, bedding, and dissolution‚Äìexpansion fracture types. The microreservoir space types include microfractures, stylolites, and micro‚Äìnanoscale pore throats. The research showed that the Fengcheng Formation has tectonic fracture-pore systems (tectonic fracture-type reservoirs) and stylolite-matrix pore-tectonic microfracture systems (shale oil reservoirs), forming the shale oil preponderant charging channel network. Reservoir space type and its spatial distribution are the principal factors for shale oil accumulation of the Fengcheng Formation in the Mahu Sag.",

         "The purpose of this study was to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) related to prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and develop a prognostic prediction model for CRC. Transcriptome data and survival information of CRC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) between CRC and normal colorectal tissues were identified by the edgeR package. The association of DElncRNAs expression with prognosis of CRC patients was analyzed by the survival package. A nomogram predicting 3- and 5- year overall survival of CRC patients was drawn by the rms package. A total of 1046 DElncRNAs were identified, including 271 down-regulated and 775 up-regulated lncRNAs in CRC. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed 10 lncRNAs related to the prognosis of CRC patients. Thereinto high expression of AC004009.1, LHX1-DT, ELFN1-AS1, AL136307.1, AC087379.2, RBAKDN and AC078820.1 was associated with poorer prognosis of CRC patients. High expression of LINC01055, AL590483.1 and AC008514.1 was associated with better prognosis of CRC patients. Furthermore, the risk score model developed based on the 10 lncRNAs could effectively predict overall survival of CRC patients. In conclusion, 10 prognostic biomarkers for CRC were identified, which would be helpful to understand the role of lncRNAs in CRC progression.",

However, the lack of recognized drug treatment method for AKI grades 1-2 is a crucial problem in clinic. Chuan Huang Fang (CHF) is a Chinese herbal formulation developed for the treatment of A on C from the Shanghai Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Our previous studies suggested that CHF might effectively protect renal functions of A on C patients. As a widely used antioxidant in clinic, reduced glutathione (RG) is reported to improve the clinical efficacy of high-flux hemodialysis (HFHD) in severe AKI patients recently. To address the crucial problem mentioned above, thus we design a new clinical protocol of CHF combining RG and try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this protocol in treating patients diagnosed with CKD stages 2-4 complicated with AKI grades 1-2.This is a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial. We intend to enroll 162 participants, and these participants will be divided into the RG group, the CHF group, and the RG + CHF group randomly assigning 1 : 1 : 1 principle. The RG group will be general treatments combining RG, the CHF group will be general treatments combining CHF, and the RG + CHF group will be general treatments combining RG and CHF. The duration of treatment will last two weeks. The primary evaluation outcome will be the change in the slope of serum creatinine (Scr) over 2 weeks. Secondary evaluation outcomes include changes in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary AKI biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18 (IL-18), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (Œ≥-GT), etc.), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) symptoms, inflammatory indicators, and oxidative stress indicators. Meanwhile, the vital sign indicators and adverse events (AEs) will be closely observed. These dates will be meticulously recorded and properly handled by investigators throughout the study. Discussion. This study will provide convictive research-derived data to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of CHF combing RG for CKD stages 2-4 complicated with AKI grades 1-2 and provide an evidence-based recommendation for clinicians. The timely completion of this trial will provide a novel drug treatment method for A on C. This trial is registered with ChiCTR2100043311 and registered on February 9, 2021.",

         "Background: The chemokine family plays an important role in the growth, invasion, and metastasis of tumors. However, most studies have only focused on a few genes or a few gene loci, and thus could not reveal the associations between functional polymorphisms of chemokine family members and tumor progression. This study aimed to determine the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of chemokine family members and the prognosis of esophageal cancer (EC). Methods: The Cox risk proportional model and log-rank test were used to analyze the associations of 16 potentially functional SNPs in 13 genes from the chemokine family with the survival of 729 Chinese patients with EC. Results: Prognostic analysis on the 16 SNPs showed that different genotypes of 5 SNPs were associated with patients‚Äô survival and the risk of death. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the risk of death was higher in CCL26rs2302009 genotype A/C carriers than in A/A carriers and it was also higher in CX3CL1rs2239352 genotype T/T carriers than in C/C carriers. Stepwise Cox regression analysis showed that CCL26rs2302009 genotype A/C was an independent prognostic factor of EC, and its association with increased risk of death was stronger in patients who were ‚â§60 years old, female, with tumors located in the middle part of esophagus, with undifferentiated or poorly differentiated tumors, with early-stage pathologic type disease, with the longest diameter of tumor ‚â§5cm than in their counterparts. Conclusion: These findings suggest that CCL26rs2302009 may be a candidate biomarker for EC and its effect on death risk are associated with the histological grade, pathologic type, and the longest diameter of tumor.

HA regulates SMC proliferation, migration, and inflammation, which accelerates neointima formation. We used the HA synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) to reduce HA production in human aortic SMCs and found a significant increase of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, the exogenous addition of HA together with 4-MU reduced apoptosis. A similar anti-apoptotic effect was observed also by adding other glycosaminoglycans and glucose to 4-MU-treated cells.

A scoping review whereby a literature search was conducted in Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases (2006-2021) to retrieve studies. No restrictions on study methodology were imposed. Out of the 1187 retrieved papers, 35 studies were finally included in the study. The articles covered various aspects, including general attitudes towards using SARs, technology acceptance theory models, and factors associated with technology acceptance. Twelve studies reported a positive attitude towards SARs. Three explicit theoretical frameworks were reported. Studies involving the elderly reported three themes that influence attitudes towards SARs: individual characteristics, concerns/problems regarding robots, and social factors. This review elucidates on the suitability of theory-based framework as applied to acceptance of SARs. We found that research on technology acceptance with regard to SARs is still in the developmental stages, and further studies of assessment tools for SARs are required. It is also essential to consider the factors that influence the acceptance of SARs by older people to ensure that they meet the end goal requirements of the user.",

         "Recent studies have shown that the primary heart tube continues to grow by addition of cells from the coelomic wall. This growth occurs concomitantly with embryonic folding and formation of the coelomic cavity, making early heart formation morphologically complex. A scarcity of data on localized growth parameters further hampers the understanding of cardiac growth. Therefore, we investigated local proliferation during early heart formation. Firstly, we determined the cell cycle length of primary myocardium of the early heart tube to be 5.5 days, showing that this myocardium is nonproliferating and implying that initial heart formation occurs solely by addition of cells. In line with this, we show that the heart tube rapidly lengthens at its inflow by differentiation of recently divided precursor cells. To track the origin of these cells, we made quantitative 3D reconstructions of proliferation in the forming heart tube and the mesoderm of its flanking coelomic walls. These reconstructions show a single, albeit bilateral, center of rapid proliferation in the caudomedial pericardial back wall. This center expresses Islet1. Cell tracing showed that cells from this caudal growth center, besides feeding into the venous pole of the heart, also move cranially via the dorsal pericardial mesoderm and differentiate into myocardium at the arterial pole. Inhibition of caudal proliferation impairs the formation of both the atria and the right ventricle. These data show how a proliferating growth center in the caudal coelomic wall elongates the heart tube at both its venous and arterial pole, providing a morphological mechanism for early heart formation.",

This study considered the psychological interviews conducted with patients with cancer &lt;10 years of age from January to December 2019. We classified the reasons why consultations were performed and the specific situations when psychologists adopted illusionist techniques. Overall, 96 children (age 4‚Äì10 years, median 7) received psychological interventions. Magic techniques were used in 30 patients: in 15 cases to support communication and relations, in 9 as a diversion, and in 2 each for physical therapy and rehabilitation, humour therapy, and psychotherapy. This preliminary descriptive experience suggests that the use of magic tricks might be helpful in providing support for communication and relations, as well for compliance and rehabilitation, for children with cancer. More analytical studies are needed to provide quantitative assessment of the efficacy of such an approach.",

Furthermore, as an example of Hilbert spaces, first we introduce the non-Cartesian plane which is a nonlinear model for plane Euclidean geometry. Secondly, we give Euclidean, unitary, and sequence spaces via corresponding norms which are induced by an inner product.

         "Developing axons reach their final targets as a result of a series of axonal projections to successive intermediate targets. Long-range chemoattraction by intermediate targets plays a key role in this process. Growing axons, however, do not stall at the intermediate targets, where the chemoattractant concentration is expected to be maximal. Commissural axons in the metencephalon, initially attracted by a chemoattractant released from the floor plate, were shown to lose responsiveness to the chemoattractant when they crossed the floor plate in vitro. Such changes in axon responsiveness to chemoattractants may enable developing axons to continue to navigate toward their final destinations.",

         "Metric-related parameters in graph theory have several applications in robotics, navigation, and chemical strata. An important such parameter is the partition dimension of graphs that plays an important role in engineering, computer science, and chemistry. In the context of chemical and pharmaceutical engineering, these parameters are used for unique representation of chemical compounds and their structural analysis. The structure of benzenoid hydrocarbon molecules is represented in the form of caterpillar trees and studied for various attributes including UV absorption spectrum, molecular susceptibility, anisotropy, and heat of atomization. Several classes of trees have been studied for partition dimension; however, in this regard, the advanced variant, the fault-tolerant partition dimension, remains to be explored. In this paper, we computed fault-tolerant partition dimension for homogeneous caterpillars <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>C</mi> <mfenced open=\"(\" close=\")\" separators=\"|\"> <mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mo>;</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </mfenced> </math> , <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>C</mi> <mfenced open=\"(\" close=\")\" separators=\"|\"> <mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mo>;</mo> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </mfenced> </math> , and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <mi>C</mi> <mfenced open=\"(\" close=\")\" separators=\"|\"> <mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mo>;</mo> <mn>3</mn> </mrow> </mfenced> </math> for <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <mi>p</mi> <mo>‚â•</mo> <mn>5</mn> </math> , <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M5\"> <mi>p</mi> <mo>‚â•</mo> <mn>3</mn> </math> , and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M6\"> <mi>p</mi> <mo>‚â•</mo> <mn>4</mn> </math> , respectively, and it is found to be constant.

         "With the development of satellite technology, space information networks (SINs) have been applied to various fields. SINs can provide more and more complex services and receive more and more tasks. The existing resource scheduling algorithms are difficult to play an efficient role in such a complex environment of resources and tasks. We propose a resource allocation scheme based on reinforcement learning. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the resources of SINs, we established the cloud computing architecture of SINs to manage the resources uniformly. Next, we adopt a variable granularity resources clustering algorithm based on fuzzy and hierarchical clustering algorithms. This algorithm can adaptively adjust the resource size and reduce the scheduling range. Finally, we model the resource scheduling process by a reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the joint resource scheduling problem. The simulation results show that the scheme can effectively reduce resources consumption, shorten the task execution time, and improve the resource utilization efficiency of SINs.",

         "The scholarly academic productivity and publication activities of anesthesia departments within the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are currently unknown. We undertook a bibliometric study to quantify UAE anesthetists' contributions to various categories of articles in peer-reviewed high-impact anesthesia journals. Using a PubMed-based analysis, we studied the contribution of United Arab Emirates (UAE) anesthetists towards publications in eight high-impact anesthesia journals (represented in the database for 2023 from Journal Citation Reports¬Æ, Thomson Scientific) and four anesthesia subspecialty journals over five years ranging from 2019 to 2023. Additionally, we searched each journal's website for publications related to the individual region of the UAE. We included all categories of articles except correspondences (not free-standing), meeting abstracts, and book reviews. We analyzed the following subsets comprehensively: region of the UAE, author's affiliation to the anesthesia department, publication focus, first authorship, and corresponding author status. UAE anesthetists were involved in 31 publications during the five-year study period. Over 25% of publications originated from the UAE; others were international collaborations. Overall, the anesthesia publication rate in the UAE was less than one per year for one million inhabitants. Only five hospitals contributed more than one publication. The Abu Dhabi Emirate's two main cities (Abu Dhabi and Al Ain) contributed 71% of publications. The UAE anesthetists' primary publication focus was regional anesthesia, medication error, and neurosurgical anesthesia in either the review or original articles category. Our study reveals that the current academic publication output from the anesthesia departments in the UAE is minimal. Our analysis suggests the need for increased scholarly activity, which could significantly advance anesthesia research and practice in the UAE.",

         "Syndrome differentiation is the most basic diagnostic method in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The process of syndrome differentiation is difficult and challenging due to its complexity, diversity, and vagueness. Recently, artificial intelligent methods have been introduced to discover the regularities of syndrome differentiation from TCM medical records, but the existing DM algorithms failed to consider how a syndrome is generated according to TCM theories. In this paper, we propose a novel topic model framework named syndrome differentiation topic model (SDTM) to dynamically characterize the process of syndrome differentiation. The SDTM framework utilizes latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to discover the latent semantic relationship between symptoms and syndromes in mass of Chinese medical records. We also use similarity measurement method to make the uninterpretable topics correspond with the labeled syndromes. Finally, Bayesian method is used in the final differentiated syndromes. Experimental results show the superiority of SDTM over existing topic models for the task of syndrome differentiation.",

         "A field experiment was carried out to identify the optimum plant density, inter and intra-row spacing for the maximum agronomic performance of Gachena (a recently released faba bean variety). A three by three factorial combinations of inter-row (30, 40, and 50 cm) and intra-row (8, 10, and 12 cm) spacing were used as treatments and laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The results of this experiment showed that there was a significant difference in all parameters measured except in 100 seed weight and harvest index. The widest inter and intra-row spacing (12 √ó 50 cm) gave a significantly higher number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, seeds per pod and seed yield per plant. Besides, it helped the crop to mature earlier than under the narrowest spacing. On the other hand, the widest spacing produced a lower leaf area index (LAI), plant height, seed yield (kg ha‚àí1) and total dry biomass (kg ha‚àí1). 30 √ó 8 cm spacing combination was found to be optimum spacing that can give the optimum economic yield on vertisols.",

         "Summary Objective Differentiation between destruction‚Äêinduced thyrotoxicosis and Graves‚Äô thyrotoxicosis is important for selection of proper therapy. It is, however, often difficult to make this distinction without measurement of radioactive iodine uptake. We investigated the possibility that assessment of thyroid blood flow would allow differentiation between the two entities. Patients and measurements One hundred and fourteen untreated patients with thyrotoxicosis (56 Graves‚Äô disease, 28 painless thyroiditis, 30 subacute thyroiditis) and 25 normal controls were examined. Serum levels of freeT4 (FT4), freeT3 (FT3) and TSH were measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay, and anti‚ÄêTSH receptor antibodies (TSH‚Äêbinding inhibitory immunoglobulin, TBII) were measured by enzyme‚Äêlinked immunosorbent assay. Thyroid volume and blood flow (TBF) were measured quantitatively by ultrasonography. Results TBF was significantly higher in Graves‚Äô disease (mean ¬± 1SD: 14¬∑9 ¬± 6¬∑4%, P &lt; 0¬∑0001) than in painless thyroiditis (0¬∑8 ¬± 0¬∑5%), subacute thyroiditis (0¬∑9 ¬± 0¬∑7%) and in normal controls (0¬∑8 ¬± 0¬∑5%). All patients with Graves‚Äô disease had TBF values of more than 4% and all patients with painless thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis had TBF values less than 4%. TBF values significantly correlated with values of radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) either at 3 h ( r = 0¬∑492, P &lt; 0¬∑01) or 24 h ( r = 0¬∑762, P &lt; 0¬∑001) within the Graves‚Äô disease and painless thyroiditis groups. There was no relationship between TBF values and thyroid volumes or values of TBII in the Graves‚Äô disease group. All patients with Graves‚Äô disease had positive TBII of 15% or more. Three of 28 patients with painless thyroiditis and one of 30 patients with subacute thyroiditis had positive TBII. Conclusion TBF was quantitatively measured by power Doppler ultrasonography and was more effective than TBII for differentiation between destruction‚Äêinduced thyrotoxicosis (painless or subacute thyroiditis) and Graves‚Äô thyrotoxicosis. TBF values of less than 4% in untreated thyrotoxic patients are laboratory signals of destruction‚Äêinduced thyrotoxicosis and if these are determined, the radioactive iodine uptake test can be omitted for differential diagnosis of these two types of thyrotoxicosis.",

         "The impossible differential attack is one of the most fundamental tools of cryptanalysis and has been successfully applied to a large variety of block ciphers. In a typical impossible differential attack, the foundation and first step is to construct an impossible differential. Nowadays, two kinds of most commonly used approaches in impossible differential construction are the matrix-based and tool-aided automatic search methods. In this paper, we proposed a new search method combining an early-abort strategy with the guess-and-determine technique to find longer impossible differentials. Compared with the previous matrix-based search methods, ours has taken the details of Sbox into consideration, while compared with the tool-aided methods, ours is independent of a third-party solver and is applicable to ciphers with large (‚â•8 bits) Sboxes, which could be tough work for tool-aided methods to cover. Therefore, more accurate results could be obtained. To prove the effectiveness of our method, it is applied to CSA and FOX64. For CSA, 23/24/25-round impossible differentials were found for CSA-BC. This improved the longest impossible differential distinguisher so far by 1/2/3 rounds. And 25-round key recovery attacks are performed against CSA-BC and CSA, which are the longest impossible differential attack by now. For FOX64, we proved that an impossible differential for its round function always implies an impossible differential for 4-round FOX64, and new types of impossible differentials were able to be found. Our method has its own advantage in dealing with large Sboxes, and it may be a possible direction to search for Sbox-related impossible differentials.",

         "The balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH) method was adopted to optimize the results of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) to analyze the changes in the brain function of patients with chronic pain accompanied by poor emotion or abnormal sleep quality in this study, so as to provide data support for the prevention and treatment of clinical chronic pain with poor emotion or sleep quality. 159 patients with chronic pain who visited the hospital were selected as the research objects, and they were grouped according to the presence or absence of abnormalities in emotion and sleep. The patients without poor emotion and sleep quality were set as the control group (60 cases), and the patients with the above symptoms were defined in the observation group (90 cases). The brain function was detected by RS-fMRI technology based on the BIRCH algorithm. The results showed that the rand index (RI), adjustment of RI (ARI), and Fowlkes-Mallows index (FMI) results in the k-means, flow cytometry (FCM), and BIRCH algorithms were 0.82, 0.71, and 0.88, respectively. The scores of Hamilton Depression Scale (HAHD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were 7.26 ¬± 3.95, 7.94 ¬± 3.15, and 8.03 ¬± 4.67 in the observation group and 4.03 ¬± 1.95, 5.13 ¬± 2.35, and 4.43 ¬± 2.07 in the control group; the higher proportion of RS-fMRI was with abnormal brain signal connections. A score of 7 or more meant that the number of brain abnormalities was more than 90% and that of less than 7 was less than 40%, showing a statistically obvious difference in contrast (P < 0.05). Therefore, the BIRCH clustering algorithm showed reliable value in the optimization of RS-fMRI images, and RS-fMRI showed high application value in evaluating the emotion and sleep quality of patients with chronic pain.",

         "Sorafenib and lenvatinib are approved first-line targeted therapies for advanced liver cancer, but most patients develop acquired resistance. Herein, we found that sorafenib induced extensive acetylation changes towards a more energetic metabolic phenotype. Metabolic adaptation was mediated via acetylation of the Lys-491 (K491) residue of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase isoform 2 (PCK2) (PCK2‚ÄìK491) and Lys-473 (K473) residue of PCK1 (PCK1‚ÄìK473) by the lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8), resulting in isoenzyme transition from cytoplasmic PCK1 to mitochondrial PCK2. KAT8-catalyzed PCK2 acetylation at K491 impeded lysosomal degradation to increase the level of PCK2 in resistant cells. PCK2 inhibition in sorafenib-resistant cells significantly reversed drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. High levels of PCK2 predicted a shorter progression-free survival time in patients who received sorafenib treatment. Therefore, acetylation-induced isoenzyme transition from PCK1 to PCK2 contributes to resistance to systemic therapeutic drugs in liver cancer. PCK2 may be an emerging target for delaying tumor recurrence.",

    "Excelente pregunta. Es el momento perfecto para reevaluar esto, ahora que hemos resuelto el problema de la identificaci√≥n de la fuente.\n",
    "\n",
    "La respuesta corta es: **S√≠, ahora s√≠ podr√≠as obtenerlo, pero el problema no era el que cre√≠as. Y la soluci√≥n tiene un coste importante.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vamos a desglosarlo.\n",
    "\n",
    "### El Verdadero Problema del `h-index` (y por qu√© fall√≥ antes)\n",
    "\n",
    "El problema para obtener el `journal_h_index` no estaba directamente relacionado con nuestro problema de *matching*. Eran dos problemas separados:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Problema de Matching (Resuelto):** Era \"¬øC√≥mo encuentro un gemelo que venga de la misma 'fuente'?\". Descubrimos que la soluci√≥n era usar el `source_id` para filtrar.\n",
    "2.  **Problema de Extracci√≥n del H-Index (El que nos ocupa ahora):** Es \"¬øUna vez que tengo un `source_id`, d√≥nde encuentro su `h-index`?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Tu intento anterior probablemente fall√≥ por una de estas dos razones:\n",
    "*   Estabas buscando el `h_index` en el lugar equivocado: dentro de la respuesta de la API para un **art√≠culo** (`/works/{doi}`). Un art√≠culo individual no contiene el h-index de toda la revista.\n",
    "*   El `source_id` que ten√≠as no era v√°lido o estaba vac√≠o, por lo que no pod√≠as hacer la consulta.\n",
    "\n",
    "### La Soluci√≥n T√©cnica (y su \"Precio\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahora que sabemos que el `source_id` es la clave, S√ç es t√©cnicamente posible obtener el `h-index`. El proceso ser√≠a el siguiente:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Haces la primera llamada a la API que ya haces en tu `get_work_features_from_doi` para obtener los datos del **art√≠culo**. De esta llamada, extraes el `source_id`.\n",
    "2.  Si el `source_id` no est√° vac√≠o, haces una **SEGUNDA LLAMADA A LA API** a un endpoint diferente: el de las \"fuentes\".\n",
    "    -   La URL ser√≠a: `https://api.openalex.org/sources/{source_id}` (ej: `.../sources/S50311662`).\n",
    "3.  La respuesta a esta segunda llamada es un objeto JSON que describe la revista, y este objeto S√ç contiene un campo llamado `h_index`.\n",
    "4.  A√±ades ese `h_index` a tu diccionario de features.\n",

    "**El \"Precio\" a Pagar: Duplicar las Llamadas a la API**\n",
    "Para cada uno de los ~110,000 art√≠culos (55k casos + 55k controles), tendr√≠as que hacer **dos** llamadas a la API en lugar de una.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Llamadas Totales:** ~220,000 en lugar de ~110,000.\n",
    "*   **Tiempo de Ejecuci√≥n:** El tiempo de recolecci√≥n se duplicar√≠a como m√≠nimo, pasando de ~3 horas a **~6 horas o m√°s**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mi Recomendaci√≥n: Un Enfoque por Fases (Mucho m√°s inteligente)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dado el alto coste en tiempo, te propongo una estrategia mucho m√°s eficiente y profesional. No intentes obtener el `h-index` *durante* la recolecci√≥n principal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fase 1: Recolecci√≥n Principal (Lo que estamos a punto de hacer)**\n",
    "1.  Lanza el script de recolecci√≥n tal y como lo tenemos ahora.\n",
    "2.  Genera tus dos datasets principales: `retracted_cases_final.csv` y `non_retracted_controls_final.csv`.\n",
    "3.  Guarda estos archivos. ¬°Ya tienes tu \"Golden Dataset\" listo para modelar!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fase 2: Script de Enriquecimiento (Un nuevo script o celdas)**\n",
    "*Despu√©s* de tener los datos, crea un nuevo proceso que haga lo siguiente:\n",
    "1.  Carga tu `retracted_cases_final.csv` y tu `non_retracted_controls_final.csv`.\n",
    "2.  J√∫ntalos en un √∫nico DataFrame.\n",
    "3.  Obt√©n la lista de `source_id` **√∫nicos** de ese DataFrame (`df['source_id'].unique()`). Esto reducir√° dr√°sticamente el n√∫mero de llamadas. En lugar de 110,000, quiz√°s solo tengas 5,000-10,000 `source_id` √∫nicos.\n",
    "4.  Crea un bucle que solo itere sobre esta lista de `source_id` √∫nicos. Para cada uno, llama a la API (`.../sources/{source_id}`) y obt√©n su `h_index`.\n",
    "5.  Guarda los resultados en un diccionario simple: `h_index_map = {'S123': 25, 'S456': 150, ...}`.\n",
    "6.  Usa `pd.merge` o `.map()` para a√±adir la nueva columna `journal_h_index` a tu DataFrame principal, usando el `h_index_map` que acabas de crear.\n",
    "7.  Guarda el DataFrame final y enriquecido como `golden_dataset_enriched.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ventajas de este enfoque:**\n",
    "-   **Mucho m√°s r√°pido:** Haces 10 veces menos llamadas a la API.\n",
    "-   **No bloqueante:** Puedes empezar a trabajar en el Notebook 02 con los datos principales mientras el script de enriquecimiento se ejecuta en segundo plano.\n",
    "-   **M√°s limpio:** Separas la l√≥gica de recolecci√≥n de la l√≥gica de enriquecimiento.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusi√≥n:**\n",
    "No, el problema no era el mismo, y la soluci√≥n no es autom√°tica. Pero ahora S√ç tenemos las herramientas para conseguirlo. Mi recomendaci√≥n es: **No lo hagas ahora.** Lanza la recolecci√≥n principal y luego, si quieres esa feature, la a√±adimos con un script de enriquecimiento mucho m√°s eficiente."
